# Simulation Results

This folder contains processed results from the ASReview simulation experiments.

Only aggregated `.csv` files are included to ensure privacy and reproducibility. Raw `.json` outputs from ASReview Makita have been excluded.

The files in this folder may include:

- `metrics_summary.csv`: Summary of recall, precision, and other evaluation metrics for each experiment.
- `wss_erf_curve.csv`: Data points used to plot WSS and ERF curves.
- `prior_article_performance.csv`: Performance metrics for each article used as prior knowledge (in ERFI-style simulations).

All results are based on anonymized datasets and simulation parameters, as described in the `README.md` and `config/experiment_configuration.txt`.
