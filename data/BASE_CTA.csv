0,[A gynaecological cause of upper abdominal pain: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome],,"A 19-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of unexplained pain in the right upper abdomen and fever. Her medical history noted a recent uncomplicated pregnancy and birth of a healthy child. Our differential diagnosis included pyelonephritis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia causing pleural pain, a gastrointestinal cause, or a subphrenic abscess. A vaginal culture was taken as part of a second opinion by a gynaecologist. However, after a few days PCR on the vaginal sample was positive for Chlamydia trachomatis, indicating a case of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. This syndrome is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease caused by a bacterial infection, most frequently Gonococcal or Chlamydia species. The patient was treated with doxycycline and recovered quickly. As a result of ignoring a possible gynaecological cause in this patient, the time to diagnosis and treatment was delayed. Left untreated, this disease might result in infertility and in complications in the newborn. A broad differential diagnosis is therefore important."
0,Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome lacking typical characteristics of pelvic inflammatory disease,10.1136/bcr-2016-215711,"A 23-year-old Japanese woman, previously a commercial sex worker, presented with a 2-day history of right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, worse on deep inspiration. She had noticed increased vaginal discharge 2 months earlier and had developed dull, lower abdominal pain 3 weeks prior to presentation. Although pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasonography revealed neither a tubal nor ovarian pathology, abdominal CT scan with contrast demonstrated early enhancement of the hepatic capsule, a finding pathognomonic for Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS). Cervical discharge PCR assay confirmed Chlamydia trachomatis infection. This case highlights that normal gynaecological evaluation may be insufficient to rule out FHCS, for which physicians should have a high index of suspicion when seeing any woman of reproductive age with RUQ pain."
0,Chlamydia ascites: a call for sexually transmitted infection testing,10.1136/bcr-2018-226437,"A 26-year-old gravida 2, para 2-0-0-2 woman with a recent uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 weeks prior presented to our hospital with 5 weeks of abdominal swelling and discomfort. Four weeks after delivery, the patient began having right upper quadrant pain and was found to have cholelithiasis. She underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy 6 weeks prior to admission, but started to develop worsening abdominal swelling 1 week postoperatively. Abdominal distension and shifting dullness were present on examination. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was remarkable for moderate-volume ascites and mild enhancement of the pelvic peritoneum. Paracentesis removed 2.46 L of ascites fluid with 76% lymphocytic predominance. Results for Chlamydia trachomatis were positive in urine, cervical swab and ascitic fluid. Doxycycline was prescribed for a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease exudative ascites. Since discharge, she has completed her antibiotic course and reports resolution of all symptoms without recurrence of ascites."
0,Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome resulting in nutmeg liver on computed tomography,10.1016/j.radcr.2019.04.008,"A 34-year-old woman entered the emergency room with abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. Computed tomography scan showed a nutmeg liver suspected for increased venous pressure by thrombosis of the liver veins, Budd-Chiari malformation, or right-sided heart failure. Interestingly, the diagnosis was pelvic inflammatory disease complicated by the Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS). Pelvic inflammatory disease resulted from an ascended infection by Chlamydia trachomatis. FHCS was caused by perihepatitis defined as inflammation of the peritoneal capsule of the liver. Fast diagnosis and treatment is crucial. Therefore, we report a case of FHCS characterized by a nutmeg liver on computed tomography."
0,[Regression of uterine cervical diffuse large B-cell lymphoma transformed from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma subsequent to Chlamydia trachomatis eradication],10.11406/rinketsu.58.912,"A 37-year-old-woman was referred to our center after her uterine cervix health screening presented abnormal findings. We performed a biopsy of the uterine cervix to examine for cervical dysplasia, and diagnosed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma transformed from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the cervix. The patient presented with concurrent chlamydial cervicitis and received eradication therapy for Chlamydia trachomatis. Four months later, the CD20 positive abnormal lymphocyte disappeared and complete remission was achieved. MALT lymphoma is considered to correlate with infection and inflammation. Particularly, the relationship between gastric MALT lymphoma and Helicobacter pylori is well known. MALT lymphoma of the uterine cervix is rare, and its relationship with C.trachomatis infection is unknown. Further studies are warranted to investigate this association."
0,Complex clinical management of group A Streptococcal pelvic inflammatory disease after bilateral tubal ligation in a small community hospital,10.1136/bcr-2020-236326,"A 43-year-old woman with a history of bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral ovarian cysts presented to our hospital with progressively worsening right lower quadrant pain and abdominal distension. Her exam findings of vaginal discharge and cervical motion tenderness, in combination with her marked leucocytosis, were suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PCR for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was negative, however, our patient's blood cultures grew group A Streptococcus This exceptionally severe presentation of PID, in combination with uncommon laboratory findings, led to complex multidisciplinary clinical decision making guided by extensive literature review. Here, we present a rare case of group A Streptococcus PID after bilateral tubal ligation, and highlight the role of a family medicine primary team in the medical and surgical management of a complex case at a community hospital."
1,Uncommon cause of pelvic inflammatory disease leading to toxic shock syndrome,10.1136/bcr-2018-224955,"A 44-year-old Caucasian female with a history of endometriosis is admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe left lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. With patients' positive chandelier sign on pelvic examination, leucocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein indicated that she had pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PCR tests were negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis; however, her blood and urine cultures grew Group A streptococci (GAS) with a negative rapid Streptococcus throat swab and no known exposure to Streptococcus On further review, patient met criteria for GAS toxic shock syndrome based on diagnostic guidelines. The patient was promptly treated with intravenous antibiotics and supportive care, and she acutely recovered. This case demonstrates a rare cause of PID and an atypical aetiology of severe sepsis. It illuminates the importance of considering PID as a source of infection for undifferentiated bacteraemia."
0,Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome: An incidental diagnostic finding in an infertility workup,10.4103/1119-3077.181357,"A case of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome in a 32-year-old para 1+1 is reported. She presented with inability to conceive of 4 years duration. Her husband's semen analysis was within normal range. She had a hysterosalpingogram that showed bilateral tubal blockage and clinical assessment showed right sided abdominal tenderness, cervical excitation tenderness, and adnexa tenderness. The endocervical swab test for Chlamydia trachomatis was a positive. Laparoscopy and dye test showed adhesion bands on the under surface of the liver (the violin string appearance). She recovered well postoperatively. The couple received ofloxacin and metronidazole for 2 weeks. Literatures on Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome presentation, pathogenesis, and management were reviewed."
0,[A FITZ-HUGH-CURTIS SYNDROME AS A PREMISE OF THE INFLAMMATORY DISEASES OF A HEPATOPANCREATOBILIARY ZONE ORGANS],,"A content of a biliary ways microflora and its correlation with clinical form and severity of inflammatory-destructive processes in hepatopancreatobiliary zone were studied up. The investigation objective was the optimization of a treatment--diagnostic tactics for the complications and remote recurrences rate reduction in a complicated biliary calculous disease. There was established, that a standard bacteriological investigation do not give a possibility to estimate some causes of a biliary ducts affection, a chlamidial infection in particular. So on, for the individual antibacterial therapy choosing a more detailed and modern examination of patients is needed."
0,A simple and rapid DNA extraction method for Chlamydia trachomatis detection from urogenital swabs,10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2017.08.007,A highly sensitive and specific Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) diagnostic test was developed by combining filtration isolation of nucleic acid (FINA) extraction with quantitative polymerase chain reaction including an internal control to identify test inhibition. A pilot study of 40 clinical specimens yielded 100% sensitivity and specificity.
0,Comparison between culture and a multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay detecting Ureaplasma urealyticum and U. parvum,10.1371/journal.pone.0102743,"A novel multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for simultaneous detection of U. urealyticum and U. parvum was developed and compared with quantitative culture in Shepard's 10 C medium for ureaplasmas in urethral swabs from 129 men and 66 women, and cervical swabs from 61 women. Using culture as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the qPCR was 96% and 95% for female urethral and cervical swabs, respectively. In male urethral swabs the sensitivity was 89%. The corresponding specificities were 100%, 87% and 99%. The qPCR showed a linear increasing DNA copy number with increasing colour-changing units. Although slightly less sensitive than culture, this multiplex qPCR assay detecting U. urealyticum and U. parvum constitutes a simple and fast alternative to the traditional methods for identification of ureaplasmas and allows simultaneous species differentiation and quantitation in clinical samples. Furthermore, specimens overgrown by other bacteria using the culture method can be evaluated in the qPCR."
0,Prevalence of genital Chlamydia trachomatis infections in Russia: systematic literature review and multicenter study,10.1093/femspd/ftx081,"A reliable overview of data on the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in Russia is lacking and needed. All the available data on CT prevalence were analyzed in a systematic literature review on CT prevalence in Russia, strengthened with data from the multicenter study among 1263 people in the second-largest Russian megalopolis, St. Petersburg, testing for CT DNA in urethral, anal, cervical and prostate samples. A total of 10 articles met the inclusion criteria. The overall average prevalence of genital CT infections in Russian populations ranged from 2.9% to 33%. Risk factors included being symptomatic (P = 0.004; in men P < 0.001), being younger than 30 years (P = 0.001) and being a man who has sex with men (MSM) (P = 0.0084). Main limitations included the lack of studies in MSM. CT prevalence was higher in the groups where urethral and prostate secretion samples were pooled (5.2%-7.3% vs 3.2% in the urethra only). The data on CT prevalence in a range of Russian populations are analyzed and reported. Prostate secretions represent an additional sampling material for the study of CT infection in men. CT detection in some settings in St. Petersburg yielded levels of reliability comparable with internationally available tests. The initiation of screening programs for Chlamydia infections in Russia should be considered."
0,[Cytology in patients with chlamydial endocervicitis],,"A short review of the biological and epidemiological established causal role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in all types of cervical cancer most cancers of the vagina and anus of the cancer of the vulva, penis, and oropharynx, as and other types of cancer causally related to HPV such as skin cancer, melanoma and cancers of the conjunctiva exposure of other sexually transmissible infections (STD), such as Chlamydia trachomatis as co-factors that modify risk are required for transfer of cervical HPV infection to cancer. PURPOSE: By comparing changes in smears in Papanycolau /PAP/ patients with chlamydial and nehlamidialen endotservitsit to assess the involvement of Chlamydia trachomatis as a cofactor for the development of cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study results direct immunofluorescence study /DIF/ for Chlamydia trachomatis and results in PAP smears. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 708 patients were sexually active at the age of 16 to 65 years, classified by age 16 to 19, 20 to 29, 30 to 65, with a proven endotservitsit of gynecological examination, with studies made Chlamydia trachomatis /DIF/, a smear Pap. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There is no difference between the average values of cytology of patients in the PAP I and PAP II, positive Chl. trachomatis, ie., And that it is statistically insignificant. The number of patients with Chl. trachomatis, PAP II /positive/, more than the number of patients with Chlamydia trachomatis PAP I /positive/ Having inflammatory changes in smear of PAP II-82/65.6% compared with PAP I-36 pieces /28.8%/ shows that two thirds of patients positive for Chl.trachomatis, have cytology PAP II. Patients with PAP IV, IV-V are in the group of Chlamydia trachomatis /negative/. These are lacking in the group of Chlamydia trachomatis /positive/. Our results give us reason to conclude that Chlamydia trachomatis is not affected by co-factor prevalence of significant abnormalities in the cervical smear, but inflammatory changes in cytology may be the result of infection with C. trachomatis"
0,Serologic markers of Chlamydia trachomatis and other sexually transmitted infections and subsequent ovarian cancer risk: Results from the EPIC cohort,10.1002/ijc.32999,"A substantial proportion of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) arises in the fallopian tube and other epithelia of the upper genital tract; these epithelia may incur damage and neoplastic transformation after sexually transmitted infections (STI) and pelvic inflammatory disease. We investigated the hypothesis that past STI infection, particularly Chlamydia trachomatis, is associated with higher EOC risk in a nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort including 791 cases and 1669 matched controls. Serum antibodies against C. trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human papillomavirus (HPV) 16, 18 and 45 were assessed using multiplex fluorescent bead-based serology. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing women with positive vs. negative serology. A total of 40% of the study population was seropositive to at least one STI. Positive serology to C. trachomatis Pgp3 antibodies was not associated with EOC risk overall, but with higher risk of the mucinous histotype (RR = 2.30 [95% CI = 1.22-4.32]). Positive serology for chlamydia heat shock protein 60 (cHSP60-1) was associated with higher risk of EOC overall (1.36 [1.13-1.64]) and with the serous subtype (1.44 [1.12-1.85]). None of the other evaluated STIs were associated with EOC risk overall; however, HSV-2 was associated with higher risk of endometrioid EOC (2.35 [1.24-4.43]). The findings of our study suggest a potential role of C. trachomatis in the carcinogenesis of serous and mucinous EOC, while HSV-2 might promote the development of endometrioid disease."
0,Case of reactive sacroiliitis possibly induced by an mRNA coronavirus disease vaccine,10.1136/bcr-2022-249063,"A woman in her 30s received a second dose, first booster, Corminaty vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2. Three days later, the patient developed unilateral sacroiliitis. A pelvic scan revealed inflammatory joint edges, bone erosion and a heterogeneous mass of 2.5 cm in the psoas muscle. Joint puncture revealed no microcrystalline deposits, but bone marrow cells, erythroblast were identified. The standard bacterial cultures and culture for mycobacteria were negative. HLA B27 was negative, and no seroconversion was identified for HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, chlamydia or Quantiferon. Two months later, the sacroiliitis resolved.The aetiologic approach of this erosive unilateral acute sacroiliitis in a person naïve to rheumatologic pathology was negative for inflammatory or infectious sacroiliitis. Arthralgias after vaccination are expected. Arthritis is less common, and acute sacroiliitis has not yet been described. Acute sacroiliitis may be considered a reactive sacroiliitis to the anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine."
0,Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome: A Diagnosis to Consider in a Woman with Right Upper Quadrant Abdominal Pain without Gallstones,10.12890/2017_000743,"A young woman presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain exacerbated by movement and breathing. Extensive evaluation revealed no gallstones or any other specific cause. Urine polymerase chain reaction results for Chlamydia trachomatis were positive, so the clinical diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome was confirmed. This type of localized peritonitis is thought to be a complication of an ascending genital infection leading to pelvic inflammatory disease. The diagnosis is established on clinical grounds after excluding alternative, more common conditions. Proper antibiotic treatment usually leads to recovery and prevents long-term complications. LEARNING POINTS: Right upper quadrant pain in a sexually active woman may be due to Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, a type of localized peritonitis also called perihepatitis.This condition is considered to be a complication of an ascending genital infection leading to pelvic inflammatory disease.Sexually active women with right upper quadrant abdominal pain without gallstones should be tested for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae."
0,2020 Hong Kong College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guideline on investigations of premenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding,10.12809/hkmj208897,"Abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women is a common gynaecological symptom and composes of abnormality in the frequency, duration, regularity, and flow volume of menstruation. It could constitute the presentation of various gynaecological malignancies. An appropriate history and physical examination are mandatory to ascertain the diagnosis. Depending on the clinical condition, a complete blood picture, thyroid function test, clotting profile, chlamydia test, cervical smear, and pregnancy test can be performed. Ultrasound should be performed in cases with a pelvic mass, unsatisfactory physical examination, persistent symptoms, or no response to medical treatment. In women aged ≥40 years, an out-patient endometrial biopsy with Pipelle should be performed. In women aged <40 years with risk factors for endometrial cancer, persistent symptoms, or no response to medical treatment, an endometrial biopsy should be performed to rule out endometrial cancer. Hysteroscopy or saline infusion sonohysterography is more sensitive than ultrasound for diagnosing endometrial pathology. Details of the above recommendations are presented."
1,Incidence of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Associated With <i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i> Infection: Evidence Synthesis of Cohort Study Data,10.1093/cid/ciaa419,"Abstract             We synthesized evidence from the POPI sexual-health cohort study and estimated that 4.9% (95% credible interval, .4–14.1%) of Mycoplasma genitalium infections in women progress to pelvic inflammatory disease versus 14.4% (5.9–24.6%) of chlamydial infections. For validation, we predicted PID rates in 4 age groups that agree well with surveillance data."
0,Evaluation of Acute Pelvic Pain in Women.,,"Acute pelvic pain is defined as noncyclic, intense pain localized to the lower abdomen and/or pelvis, with a duration of less than three months. Signs and  symptoms are often nonspecific. The differential diagnosis is broad, based on the  patient's age and pregnancy status and gynecologic vs. nongynecologic etiology.  Nongynecologic etiologies include gastrointestinal, urinary, and musculoskeletal  conditions. Urgent gynecologic conditions include ectopic pregnancy, ruptured  ovarian cyst, adnexal torsion, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Approximately 40%  of ectopic pregnancies are misdiagnosed at the presenting visit. Urgent  nongynecologic conditions include appendicitis and pyelonephritis. Less urgent  etiologies include sexually transmitted infections, pelvic floor myofascial pain,  dysmenorrhea, and muscle strain. Approximately 15% of untreated chlamydia  infections lead to pelvic inflammatory disease. History and physical examination  findings guide laboratory testing. Questions should focus on the type, onset,  location, and radiation of pain; timing and duration of symptoms; aggravating and  relieving factors; and associated symptoms. Performing a urine pregnancy test or  beta human chorionic gonadotropin test is an important first step for sexually  active, premenopausal patients. Imaging options should be considered, with  transvaginal ultrasonography first, followed by computed tomography. Magnetic  resonance imaging can be useful if ultrasonography and computed tomography are  nondiagnostic."
0,Sexual health issues in adolescents and young adults,10.7861/clinmedicine.15-5-447,"Adolescence is a time of sexual risk-taking and experimentation but also vulnerability. Young people may present to general physicians with systemic symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as arthritis, hepatitis or rash, but may not necessarily volunteer information about sexual activity. It is important for physicians to ask directly about sexual risks and if appropriate test for STIs and pregnancy. Knowing how to take a sexual history and consent a patient for an HIV test are core medical skills that all physicians should be trained to competently perform. Safeguarding young people is the responsibility of all healthcare professionals who come into contact with them, and young victims of abuse may present with physical symptoms such as abdominal pain or deliberate self-harm. We must all be aware of indicators of both child sexual exploitation and HIV infection and not be afraid to ask potentially awkward questions. If we don't we may miss vital opportunities to prevent or minimise harm to young people."
0,Endocervical and vaginal microbiota in South African adolescents with asymptomatic Chlamydia trachomatis infection,10.1038/s41598-018-29320-x,"Adolescent girls and young women represent a key risk group for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The vaginal microbiota is thought to play an important role in susceptibility to STIs such as Chlamydia trachomatis. We compared the microbiota of the lateral vaginal wall and endocervix, and assessed associations with C. trachomatis infection in South African adolescents. The endocervical and vaginal lateral wall microbiota were characterized by amplifying and sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and C. trachomatis diagnosed using molecular methods. Of the 72 girls included, 30 had asymptomatic C. trachomatis infections. Three major vaginal community types were identified; one Lactobacillus crispatus, one L. iners and one diverse, Gardnerella vaginalis dominant. The microbiota of the endocervix was significantly different from that of the lateral wall in terms of diversity. There were many differentially abundant taxa between the endocervix and lateral vaginal wall, including Achromobacter spanius and Enterococcus faecium. Women with C. trachomatis had higher relative abundance of G. vaginalis and other anaerobes. In this African adolescent cohort, significant differences between the lateral vaginal wall and endocervical microbiota diversity and composition were evident, although neither were strongly associated with C. trachomatis infection."
1,A retrospective cohort study examining STI testing and perinatal records demonstrates reproductive health burden of chlamydia and gonorrhea,10.1093/femspd/ftaa052,"Adverse reproductive health outcomes, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility, have been associated with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea infections. These reproductive health outcomes could be complemented by measuring subsequent pregnancies to assess impact on fertility. The study design was a cohort study of women in Queensland (QLD), Australia, using data linkage methods to link chlamydia and/or gonorrhea testing records (including an unexposed group undergoing full blood count tests; 2000 and 2005) with the QLD Perinatal Registry (2000-2013). The cohort included 132 962 women, with 69 533 records of pregnancies. Women in the exposed group, with no prior pregnancy, had a reduced odds of a pregnancy during the follow up of the study (20-year-old (at 2005) aOR 0.91 95% CI 0.87-0.95, and 25-year-old aOR 0.71 95% CI 0.68-0.75). Women in the exposed group with a prior pregnancy had increased odds of pregnancy during the follow up of the study (20-year-old (at 2005) aOR 1.72 95% CI 1.59-1.86, and 25-year-old aOR 1.35 95% CI 1.26-1.45). Our data provides further evidence at a population level of the significant impact on reproductive outcomes associated with chlamydia and gonorrhea."
0,Aerobic vaginitis: no longer a stranger,10.1016/j.resmic.2017.04.004,"Aerobic vaginitis (AV) is the name given in 2002 to a vaginal infectious entity which was not recognized as such before. It is characterized by abnormal (dysbiotic) vaginal microflora containing aerobic, enteric bacteria, variable levels of vaginal inflammation and deficient epithelial maturation. Although AV and bacterial vaginosis (BV) share some characteristics, such as a diminished number or absence of lactobacilli, increased discharge (fishy smelling in BV, while in severe forms of AV, a foul, rather rotten smell may be present) and increased pH (often more pronounced in AV), there are also striking differences between the two. There is no inflammation in women with BV, whereas the vagina of women with AV often appears red and edematous, and may even display small erosions or ulcerations. The color of the discharge in BV is usually whitish or gray and of a watery consistency, whereas in AV it is yellow to green and rather thick and mucoid. Women with BV do not have dyspareunia, while some women with severe AV do. Finally, the microscopic appearance differs in various aspects, such as the presence of leucocytes and parabasal or immature epithelial cells in AV and the absence of the granular aspect of the microflora, typical of BV. Despite all these differences, the distinction between AV and BV was not recognized in many former studies, leading to incomplete and imprecise diagnostic workouts and erroneous management of patients in both clinical and research settings. The prevalence of AV ranges between 7 and 12%, and is therefore less prevalent than BV. Although still largely undiagnosed, many researchers and clinicians increasingly take it into account as a cause of symptomatic vaginitis. AV can co-occur with other entities, such as BV and candidiasis. It can be associated with dyspareunia, sexually transmitted infections (such as human papilloma virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Trichomonas vaginalis and Chlamydia trachomatis), chorioamnionitis, fetal infection, preterm birth and cervical dysplasia. Many other possible pathological associations are currently under investigation. The diagnosis of AV is made using wet mount microscopy, ideally using phase contrast. An AV score is calculated, according to: lactobacillary grade, presence of inflammation, proportion of toxic leucocytes, characteristics of the microflora and presence of immature epithelial cells. To circumvent the hurdle of microscopic investigation, some groups have begun to develop nucleic-acid-based and enzymatic diagnostic tests, but the detailed information obtained with phase contrast microscopy is irreplaceable. The best treatment is not yet fully determined, but it must be tailored according to the microscopic findings and the patient's needs. There is a role for local estrogen therapy, corticosteroids, antimicrobials and probiotics. Further research will reveal more precise data on diagnosis, pathogenesis, management and prevention."
0,Correlation between cervical infection and preterm labor,10.17392/886-16,"Aim To investigate a correlation between cervical canal infection and imminent preterm labor and to identify most frequent pathogens. Methods A prospective study was conducted in obstetrics/gynecology departments of Health Center and the University Clinical Center Tuzla, and General Hospital Tešanj (Bosnia and Herzegovina, B&H) between October 2013 and May 2014. An examined group included 50 healthy pregnant women with singleton pregnancy of the gestation age between the 28th and 37th week, with cervical changes that are related to imminent preterm labor. Changes were detected by ultrasound biometry of cervix and modified Bishop score. A control group included 30 healthy pregnant women with singleton pregnancy of the gestation age between the 28th and 37th week of pregnancy without signs of imminent preterm labor. Cervical mucus was microbiologically analyzed for identification of pathogens. Results The infection in cervical canal was proven in 35 (70%) examinees and four (13%) patients from the control group (p=0.015). In seven (20%) cases each Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma were detected followed by E. coli in five (14%) cases (p=0.001). Conclusion Cervical canal infection is associated with changes on cervix and premature rupture of fetal membranes, i.e. preterm labor and imminent preterm labor. Screening for infection before pregnancy should be the main task of family doctors as well as gynecologists."
0,"Molecular investigation of menstrual tissue for the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis collected by women with a history of infertility",10.1111/jog.12165,"AIM: At present, routine laboratory investigation of the infectious agents implicated in female genital infections is mainly based on culture/direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) (immunofluorescence antibody test) results of cervicovaginal secretions. In this study the use of the menstrual tissue is introduced for the molecular detection of pathogens which are implicated in female infertility. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cervicovaginal secretions and menstrual tissue samples of 87 women (mean age 34.07 ± 5.17) experiencing infertility problems were screened for Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis presence using polymerase chain reaction (PCR, light cycler-PCR). Cervicovaginal secretions were also tested by the culture/DFA technique. The results were compared using the binomial test. RESULTS: In the overall study group, the prevalence of C. trachomatis was 25.3%, 18.3%, and 13.8%, the prevalence of U. urealyticum was 18.3%, 16.09% and 12.6% and the prevalence of M. hominis was 13.7%, 19.5% and 8.0% in the menstrual tissue, cervicovaginal secretions using PCR and cervicovaginal secretions culture/DFA, respectively. A statistically significant difference was revealed between the two methods for all three microbes and between menstrual tissue and cervicovaginal secretions PCR for chlamydia. CONCLUSIONS: The use of menstrual tissue along with the PCR method seems to be an effective and thus novel alternative for the investigation of the infectious agents lying in the genital tract. One of the main advantages of this technique compared to cervicovaginal secretions is that it is non-invasive and the sample can be collected at home, thus allowing the early detection and treatment of a condition that can otherwise lead to serious consequences, such as tubal obstruction, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortions and unexplained infertility."
0,Influence of co-infection complicated with human papillomavirus on cervical intraepithelial neoplasia development in patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance,10.1016/j.jiac.2017.08.008,"AIM: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection is a primary cause of the development of cervical precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. However, the influence of other infections on intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) development has not been fully elucidated. We evaluated the association between co-infection and CIN development in subjects with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). METHOD: Data for ASCUS subjects who had undergone testing for high risk HPV (HR-HPV) and pathological diagnosis were analyzed. From the CIN grade, HR-HPV and vaginal infection (VI) data, both the relationship between HPV infection and CIN development and the influence of co-infection on CIN were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Data for 56 ASCUS subjects who had undergone HR-HPV testing and cytological diagnosis were analyzed. Positive rates were HPV (73.2%), HPV16 (21.4%), HPV18 (7.1%), and HPV16 and/or 18 (26.8%). Seventeen of the subjects were diagnosed as having one or more VI pathogen; the major pathogens found were Candida spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococcus, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, and Chlamydia trachomatis. The rate of CIN 2 or worse (≥CIN 2) was significantly higher in subjects positive for HPV16 compared with HPV negative subjects, and was significantly higher in subjects with a VI complicated with HPV compared to those without a VI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis identified positive for HPV16 and/or 18 and positive for VI to be significant variables for ≥ CIN 2. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that having a vaginal infection complicated with HR-HPV affects the development of CIN in subjects with ASCUS cytology."
0,Molecular etiopathology of naturally occurring reproductive diseases in female goats,10.14202/vetworld.2017.964-972,"AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular etiopathology of occurrence of reproductive diseases in female goats. Reproductive diseases in goats account for major economic losses to goat farmers in terms of valuable loss of offspring and animal productivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 660 female genitalia were examined for pathological conditions (macroscopic and microscopic lesions). The etiopathological study was carried out for the presence of pathogenic organisms such as Brucella, Chlamydia, and Campylobacter in the uterus and ovary. Based on the microscopic lesions, suspected samples were subjected to diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for various etiological agents employing 16srRNA genus specific primers for Campylobacter and Chlamydophila and OMP31 gene-based PCR for Brucella melitensis and nested PCR using ITS-1 gene primers for Toxoplasma gondii. For Brucella suspected samples, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also performed. RESULTS: In studied female genitalia, 108 (16.30%) showed gross abnormalities with overall 23.32% occurrence of pathological conditions (macroscopic and microscopic lesions). Pathological involvement of the uterus was the highest 68 (62.96%), followed by the ovaries 27 (25%) and other organs. Major uterine condition observed was endometritis (5.60%). In uterine infections, 35 (5.30%) samples were found positive for Campylobacter spp., 12 (1.81%) samples for B. melitensis, and 3 (0.45%) samples were positive for Chlamydophila spp. Among the samples positive for B. melitensis by PCR, 3 were found positive by IHC also. Corynebacterium ovis was detected by PCR using specific primers in a case of hydrosalpinx. It was concluded that many pathological lesions in female genitalia of functional significance play a major role in infertility in goats. CONCLUSION: The present study concluded that many pathological lesions in female genitalia of functional significance play a major role in infertility in goats."
0,[Endometrial dysfunction caused by chronic endometritis: сlinical and morphological aspects],10.17116/patol201779622-29,"AIM: to determine the clinical and morphological aspects of endometrial dysfunction caused by chronic endometritis (CE). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 239 reproductive-aged patients: 93 were examined for abnormal uterine bleeding; 37 patients of them had a history of miscarriage and secondary infertility, 17 patients had primary infertility (Group 1). The remaining 105 patients with infertility were examined for future in vitro fertilization (Group 2). A comparison group consisted of 41 patients with normal menstrual cycles and reproductive function across the cycle, who had separate diagnostic curettage before forthcoming surgery for uterine myoma. All the women in Groups 1 and 2 underwent standard clinical and morphological investigations, histopathological examination of the material obtained during hysteroscopy with separate diagnostic curettage (Group 1), and aspiration biopsy (Group 2) with the sections being stained with hematoxylin and eosin and by Mallory's method. Immunohistochemical diagnosis was used to assess endometrial receptivity to steroid hormones and glycodelin. Antibodies against CD4, СD8, and CD20 were employed to study local immunity. RESULTS: In Group 1, 52 (55.9%) of the 93 patients admitted to hospital for abnormal uterine bleeding were found to have CE on the basis of a morphopathological examination of the material after separate diagnostic study. In Group 2, CE was established in 59 (56.9%) of the 105 patients after postmortem examination. The patients with CE had a history of reproductive significant infections, such as Chlamydia, Trichomonas, Ureaplasma Mycoplasma, cytomegalovirus, papillomavirus infections, genital herpes, genital candidiasis, and bacterial vaginosis. The CE groups showed functional disorders of the endometrial glandular and surface epithelium. In the middle stage of proliferation, the expression of glycodelin in the glandular epithelial cells was detected to be moderate to strong in 83.3%. During the periovulatory period, no secretion of glycodelin is of fundamental importance for the regulation of reproductive function because this protein has contraceptive activity, by blocking the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida. Accordingly, endometrial glycodelin production during the proliferative phase, which has been identified by the authors in patients with CE, may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms for the development of infertility. In addition, the patients in Groups 1 and 2 compared with those in the comparison group were noted to have a decrease in CD4 cell counts with a simultaneous increase in CD8 expression and a reduction in CD20 levels, especially in Group 2. CONCLUSION: The patients with SE were identified to have endometrial dysfunction characterized by lower reception to steroid hormones, impairment in glycodelin secretion, retardation in the development of pinopods and in the phase of the menstrual cycle, and local immunity disorders. The above endometrial changes should be taken into account in the pregravid preparation of patients with CE."
0,[Performance of a standardized interrogation to improve the screening of Chlamydia trachomatis infection],10.1016/j.jgyn.2014.09.003,"AIM: To estimate the performance of a standardized interrogation tool facilitating the detection and screening of patients for the Chlamydia trachomatis infection, to estimate the prevalence of the infection in the family planning population studied. METHOD: Prospective observational study, including the patients who had a consultation in the abortion center in the CHU of Poitiers. A sampling of the cervix was systematically carried out after the standardized interrogation in search of four clinical signs. The samples were analyzed by genetic amplification. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-six women were included and 56 (14.5 %) infections were identified. The medical history questionnaire was relatively effective for 2 or 3 clinical signs. The positive predictive value (PPV) was respectively 34.8 % and 53.8 % and was very relevant for 4 clinical signs with PPV at 83.3 % [CI 95 %: 74-93 %]. Among the infected women, 48.2 % had no clinical sign revealed by the medical history questionnaire. The presence of any clinical sign was strongly associated with the C. trachomatis infection (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The clinical signs find in the standardized interrogation are all significantly associated with the C. trachomatis infection."
0,Chlamydia muridarum induction of glandular duct dilation in mice,10.1128/IAI.00154-15,"Although Chlamydia-induced hydrosalpinx in women and mice has been used as a surrogate marker for tubal infertility, the medical relevance of nontubal pathologies, such as uterine horn dilation, developed in mice following chlamydial infection remains unclear. We now report that the uterine horn dilation correlates with glandular duct dilation detected microscopically following Chlamydia muridarum infection. The dilated glandular ducts pushed the uterine horn lumen to closure or dilation and even broke through the myometrium to develop extrusion outside the uterine horn. The severity scores of uterine horn dilation observed macroscopically correlated well with the number of cross sections of the dilated glandular ducts counted under microscopy. Chlamydial infection was detected in the glandular epithelial cells, potentially leading to inflammation and dilation of the glandular ducts. Direct delivery of C. muridarum into the mouse uterus increased both uterine horn/glandular duct dilation and hydrosalpinx. However, the chlamydial plasmid, which is essential for the induction of hydrosalpinx, was not required for the induction of uterine horn/glandular duct dilation. Screening 12 strains of mice for uterine horn dilation following C. muridarum infection revealed that B10.D2, C57BL/10J, and C57BL/6J mice were most susceptible, followed by BALB/cJ and A/J mice. Deficiency in host genes involved in immune responses failed to significantly alter the C. muridarum induction of uterine horn dilation. Nevertheless, the chlamydial induction of uterine horn/glandular duct dilation may be used to evaluate plasmid-independent pathogenicity of Chlamydia in susceptible mice."
0,"Diagnosis of a neonatal ophthalmic discharge, Ophthalmia neonatorum, in the molecular age: investigation for a correct therapy",,"An early double case of acute Ophthalmia neonatorum in 3-day-old twins is reported. Culture of eye swabs showed a wide bacterial polymorphism, in which common bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium ulcerans and other Enterobacteriaceae, coexisted with atypical Mycoplasmataceae and Chlamydiaceae from resident cervical-vaginal maternal microbiota. The neonates were in an apparently healthy state, but showed red eyes with abundant greenish-yellow secretion, mild chemosis and lid edema. The maternal cervical-vaginal ecosystem resulted differently positive to the same common cultivable, atypical bacteria culturally and molecularly determined. This suggested a direct maternal-foetal transmission or a further foetal contamination before birth. An extended culture analysis for common bacteria to atypical ones was decisive to describe the involvement of Mycoplasmas (M. hominis and U. urealyticum) within the scenario of the Ophthalmia neonatorum in a Caucasian couple. The introduction of a routine PCR molecular analysis for Chlamydiaceae and N. gonorrhoeae allowed to establish which of these were present at birth, and contributed to determine the correct laboratory diagnosis and to define an adequate therapeutic protocol obtaining a complete resolution after one year for culture and atypical bacteria controls. This study suggests to improve the quality of laboratory diagnosis as unavoidable support to a correct clinical diagnosis and therapy, in a standardized modality both for swabbing and scraping, to check the new-born microbial programming starting in uterus, overtaking the cultural age to the molecular age, and to revise the WHO guidelines of SAFE Strategy for trachoma eye disease, transforming it into SAFES Strategy where the S letter is the acronym of Sexual ecosystem and behavioural valuation/education."

However, inappropriate use of an eponym may lead to potentially dangerous miscommunication. Moreover, an eponym may honor the incorrect person or a person who falls into disrepute. Despite their limitations, eponyms are still widespread in medicine. Many commonly used eponyms applied to extremity fractures should be familiar to most emergency radiologists and have been previously reported. Yet, a number of non-extremity eponyms can be encountered in an emergency radiology practice as well. This other group of eponyms encompasses a spectrum of traumatic and nontraumatic pathology. In this second part of a two-part series, the authors discuss a number of non-extremity emergency radiology eponyms, including relevant clinical and imaging features, as well biographical information of the eponyms' namesakes."
1,"Chlamydia screening and positivity in juvenile detention centers, United States, 2009-2011",10.1080/03630242.2014.932890,"An estimated 2.9 million new chlamydia infections occur in the United States each year. Among women, chlamydia can lead to serious adverse outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Chlamydia prevalence is highest among females aged 15-19 years. Despite long-standing recommendations directed at young, sexually active females, screening remains sub-optimal. Juvenile detention centers (JDCs) are uniquely situated to screen and treat high-risk adolescents. From 2009-2011, performance measure data on chlamydia screening coverage (proportion of eligible females screened) and positivity (proportion of females tested who were positive) were available from 126 geographically-dispersed JDCs in the United States. These facilities reported screening 55.2% of females entering the facilities (149,923), with a facility-specific median of 66.4% (range: 0-100%). Almost half (44.4%) of facilities had screening coverage levels of 75-100%. This screening resulted in the detection of 12,305 chlamydial infections, for an overall positivity of 14.7% (facility-specific median = 14.9%, range: 0-36.9%). In linear regression analysis, chlamydia positivity was inversely associated with screening coverage: as coverage increased, positivity decreased. The burden of chlamydia in JDCs is substantial; facilities should continue to deliver recommended chlamydia screening and treatment to females and identify mechanisms to increase coverage."

Most of media show a good correlation for all the performance characteristics studied. Cyt-All and NovaPrep HQ+ media are perfectly concordant with PreservCyt all parameters and genotypes considered. CMDH and M4RT have a reduced stability at +25°C (3 and 2 days respectively) and would not be conformed to current shipping practices. Most of media tested show analytical and stability performances equivalent with the reference medium. The prospects of such study are interesting because in the near future, providers would make available media adapted to the problem of cervical smear but also to the conservation, transport of virus or bacteria for performing simultaneous searches of HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhea."
1,[Prevention of postoperative or associated of care pelvic inflammatory diseases. Is there a need for antibiotic prophylaxis for first trimester surgical-induced abortion to prevent pelvic inflammatory diseases? CNGOF good practice points],10.1016/j.gofs.2020.06.007,"Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended during surgical induced abortions. Systematic screening for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrheae infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a vaginal sample is recommended before any surgical abortion. Moreover, the bacteriological result should be available before the abortion so that antibiotic treatment effective against the identified bacteria, if any, can be proposed before the procedure. The absence of bacteriological result on the day of the abortion must not, however, delay the procedure. If screening is positive for a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and the bacteriological result is only available after the abortion, it is recommended that antibiotic treatment start as soon as possible. The first-line antibiotic treatment is ceftriaxone 500mg in a single dose by the intramuscular route for N. gonorrheae, doxycycline 200mg per day orally for 7 days for C. trachomatis and azithromycin 500mg the first day (D1) then 250mg per day from D2 to D4 orally if Mycoplasma genitalium is detected by multiplex PCR. In case of positive screening, antibiotic treatment of the woman's partner(s) is recommended, adapted to the STI agent(s)."

We compared the performance of three platforms to detect antibodies against the Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) antigen Pgp3 - multiplex bead array (MBA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and lateral flow assay (LFA) - on sera from adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Ninety-five of 118 AYAs diagnosed with PID (80.5%) had positive antibody response to Pgp3 antigen by at least one test, and 78 (66.1%) tested positive by all three tests. Among 27 individuals with infection detected using nucleic acid amplification testing, 92.6% were positive by MBA (25/27), 77.8% (21/27) were positive by ELISA, and 74.1% (20/27) were positive by LFA. These data suggest that the MBA was the most sensitive of the three tests and could be useful in seroepidemiologic studies designed to assess population-level exposure to CT."
0,Breaking Down the Barrier: The Role of Cervical Infection and Inflammation in Preterm Birth,10.3389/fgwh.2021.777643,"Approximately 40% of cases of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) are associated with ascending intrauterine infections. The cervix serves as a physical and immunological gatekeeper, preventing the ascent of microorganisms from the vagina to the amniotic cavity. The cervix undergoes remodeling during pregnancy. It remains firm and closed from the start until the late third trimester of pregnancy and then dilates and effaces to accommodate the passage of the fetus during delivery. Remodeling proceeds appropriately and timely to maintain the pregnancy until term delivery. However, risk factors, such as acute and chronic infection and local inflammation in the cervix, may compromise cervical integrity and result in premature remodeling, predisposing to sPTB. Previous clinical studies have established bacterial (i.e., chlamydia, gonorrhea, mycoplasma, etc.) and viral infections (i.e., herpesviruses and human papillomaviruses) as risk factors of PTB. However, the exact mechanism leading to PTB is still unknown. This review focuses on: (1) the epidemiology of cervical infections in pregnant patients; (2) cellular mechanisms that may explain the association of cervical infections to premature cervical ripening and PTB; (3) endogenous defense mechanisms of the cervix that protect the uterine cavity from infection and inflammation; and (4) potential inflammatory biomarkers associated with cervical infection that can serve as prognostic markers for premature cervical ripening and PTB. This review will provide mechanistic insights on cervical functions to assist in managing cervical infections during pregnancy."
1,Gonorrhea: new challenges,10.1016/j.clindermatol.2013.08.010,"As ""a paradigm of the classical Venereology"" for many decades, gonorrhea appears to be the second most common sexually transmitted infection of bacterial origin today. In spite of its mostly uncomplicated clinical course, gonorrhea may sometimes result with serious complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, epididymitis, gonococcemia, and disseminated gonococcal infection. Perhaps the most important challenge today is the emergence of multidrug-resistant gonorrhea, which is currently the main reason for public concern. Eventually, Neisseria gonorrhoeae turned out to be one of the most ""evolutionarily successful"" pathogens. Effective treatment of gonorrhea providing that N gonorrhoeae might also facilitate the transmission of HIV is a complex task and almost an imperative in the ""sexually transmitted infection world"" today."
0,Chlamydia Trachomatis Infection-Associated Risk of Cervical Cancer: A Meta-Analysis,10.1097/MD.0000000000003077,"As whether Chlamydia trachomatis infection increases the risk of cervical cancer is controversial in the literature, we performed a meta-analysis.Based on a comprehensive search of publications in the Medline, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases, we identified and extracted data from all relevant articles examining C. trachomatis infection and the risk of cervical cancer. The quality of each included study was assessed according to the 9-star Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The strength of association between the C. trachomatis and risk of cervical cancer was estimated by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This review was registered at PROSPERO with registration No. CRD42014015672. A total of 22 studies with 4291 cervical cancer cases and 7628 controls were identified. Overall, C. trachomatis was significantly linked to increased cervical cancer risk in prospective studies (OR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.88-2.61, P < 0.001), as well as in retrospective studies (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.74-2.74, P < 0.001). Additionally, with a multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for HPV and age, C. trachomatis infection was identified as an independent predictor of cervical cancer in 11 studies (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.03-3.01, P = 0.04). Coinfection of human papilloma virus and C. trachomatis has a higher risk of cervical cancer (OR = 4.03, 95% CI: 3.15-5.16, P < 0.001). A subgroup analysis based on histological type indicated an elevated risk for both squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 2.21, 95% CI: 2.00-2.45, P < 0.001), and adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.21-2.15, P = 0.001), in associated with C. trachomatis. Subgroup analysis by where C. trachomatis infection was detected showed a significantly higher risk of cervical cancer associated with C. trachomatis infection detected in serum (OR = 2.20, 95% CI: 2.01-2.42, P < 0.001), cervical tissue blocks (OR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.21-6.83, P = 0.02), and cervical secretion (OR = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.41-5.20, P = 0.003), especially in serum with no obvious heterogeneity.In conclusion, our novel data demonstrate that individuals infected with C. trachomatis have a higher risk of cervical cancer. Therefore, it is necessary to expand C. trachomatis infection screening and treat women with C. trachomatis promptly, particularly those with human papilloma virus infections. This approach will not only protect against pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility, but may also prevent cervical cancer."
0,Uterotubal junction prevents chlamydial ascension via innate immunity,10.1371/journal.pone.0183189,"Ascension to the oviduct is necessary for Chlamydia to induce tubal infertility. Using the Chlamydia muridarum induction of hydrosalpinx mouse model, we have demonstrated a significant role of the uterotubal junction in preventing chlamydial ascending infection. First, delivery of C. muridarum to either side of the uterotubal junction resulted in significant reduction in live organisms from the tissues on the opposite sides. However, the recovery yields remained similar among different sections of the uterine horn. These observations suggest that the uterotubal junction may function as a barrier between the uterine horn and oviduct. Second, deficiency in innate immunity signaling pathways mediated by either MyD88 or STING significantly compromised the uterotubal junction barrier function, permitting C. muridarum to spread freely between uterine horn and oviduct. Finally, transcervical inoculation of C. muridarum led to significantly higher incidence of bilateral hydrosalpinges in the STING-deficient mice while the same inoculation mainly induced unilateral hydrosalpinx in the wild type mice, suggesting that the STING pathway-dependent uterotubal junction plays a significant role in preventing tubal pathology. Thus, we have demonstrated for the first time that the uterotubal junction is a functional barrier for preventing tubal infection by a sexually transmitted agent, providing the first in vivo evidence for detecting chlamydial infection by the STING pathway."

Laboratory tests showed low serum-ascites albumin gradient, high total protein, and low adenosine. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed inflammatory signs of both fallopian tubes. The histopathological results from peritoneal biopsy were consistent with lymphoid proliferation with reactive lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. A gynecological investigation showed a positive DNA for C. trachomatis in the cervical swab. After treatment with doxycycline, there was a complete resolution of ascites."
0,Combined effect of diet and cervical microbiome on the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,10.1016/j.clnu.2016.03.019,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several food groups or dietary factors and the cervical microbiota may be involved in cervical carcinogenesis, but the evidence is not clear yet. We aimed to assess the association between dietary pattern and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and the combined effect of dietary pattern and cervical microbiome on the risk of CIN. METHODS: The cervical microbiota and diet assessed by pyrosequencing and a food-frequency questionnaire, respectively, of 65 women with CIN and 72 control women were used in this study. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis were used to identify dietary patterns and microbiome community types, respectively. The association between dietary pattern and CIN risk was assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The combined effect of dietary pattern and microbiome on CIN risk was determined using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and synergy index (S). RESULTS: Two dietary patterns and four community types were identified: prudent diet characterized by higher intake of vegetables and fishes; semi-Western diet characterized by higher intake of bread, dairy products, eggs, and soft drinks and relatively higher fat intake ratio; and Lactobacillus crispatus-, L. iners-, Atopobium vaginae-, and Prevotella bivia-dominant types. The high-scoring group of participants with a semi-Western diet had a higher risk of CIN (odds ratio [OR] 3.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-10.7, p = 0.03), compared with the low or medium-scoring group of those with a semi-Western diet. L. iners-dominant (OR 6.39, 95% CI 1.52-26.7, p = 0.01) and A. vaginae-dominant (OR 4.99, 95% CI 1.17-21.3, p = 0.03) dominant types had a higher risk of CIN, compared with the L. crispatus-dominant type. The synergistic effect of semi-Western diet and A. vaginae-dominant type on CIN risk was observed (OR 20.8, 95% CI 2.21-195.6, p = 0.01, RERI/S 9.64/1.96). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that semi-Western diet and its combination with A. vaginae-dominant microflora may represent an important risk factor for cervical neoplasia."
0,Association of Chlamydia trachomatis infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) & cervical intraepithelial neoplasia - a pilot study,,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the necessary cause of cervical cancer and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is considered a potential cofactor in the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The objective of this pilot study was to determine the association of CT infection with HPV, other risk factors for cervical cancer, and CIN in symptomatic women. METHODS: A total of 600 consecutively selected women aged 30-74 yr with persistent vaginal discharge, intermenstrual/postcoital bleeding or unhealthy cervix underwent conventional Pap smear, Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) testing for HPV and CT DNA and colposcopy, with directed biopsy of all lesions. RESULTS: HPV DNA was positive in 108 (18.0%) women, CT DNA in 29 (4.8%) women. HPV/CT co-infection was observed in only four (0.7%) women. Of the 127 (21.2%) women with Pap >ASCUS, 60 (47.2%) were HPV positive and four (3.1%) were CT positive. Of the 41 women with CIN1 lesions, 11 (26.8%) were HPV positive, while two were CT positive. Of the 46 women with CIN2+ on histopathology, 41 (89.1%) were HPV positive, two (4.3%) were CT positive and one was positive for both. The risk of CIN2+ disease was significantly increased (P<0.05) by the following factors: age <18 yr at first coitus, HPV infection and a positive Pap smear. Older age (>35 yr), higher parity, use of oral contraceptives or smoking did not show any significant association with HPV or abnormal histopathology. Parity >5 was the only risk factor positivity associated with CT infection (P<0.05). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that CT infection was not significantly associated with CIN, and most of its risk factors, including HPV infection, in symptomatic women. Longitudinal studies with carefully selected study sample would be able to answer these questions."
1,"Trends in diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease in an Australian sexual health clinic, 2002-16: before and after clinical audit feedback",10.1071/SH18119,"Background A 2006 Australian sexual health clinic audit of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) diagnosis rates found variability between doctors. Doctors were given audit feedback towards increasing diagnosis and reducing variability. The clinic implemented other improvements to increase capacity. This study investigated PID diagnosis time trends before and after feedback. METHODS: Yearly PID diagnosis rates for women aged 16-49 years attending the clinic (2002-16) were calculated. Using multivariable generalised linear mixed models, adjusted for patient risk and lower genital infection (any of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, Mycoplasma genitalium, bacterial vaginosis) and stratified by before (2002-June 2007) and after (July 2007-2016) feedback, we assessed if PID rates changed over time, accounting for between-doctor variability. RESULTS: During 2002-16, 144 doctors undertook 84476 female consultations and diagnosed 1755 (2.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-2.2) with PID. Comparing 2002-03 to 2015-16, the yearly PID rate increased; 0.8% (37/4836) to 2.9% (209/7088). Comparing before and after feedback more women reported any symptoms at triage (35.1%-47.2%) or had a lower genital infection diagnosed (10.1%-14.9%). After feedback, PID rates increased by 8% yearly (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.11), but were unchanged (adjusted IRR (aIRR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.98-1.03) after adjustment for patient characteristics. Factors associated with PID were self-reported symptoms, younger age and a lower genital infection. Lower variability in doctor-specific rates was observed after feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing PID diagnosis rates appeared to be driven by a greater female patient risk profile, influenced by increased capacity following service improvements."
0,Epidemiological Trends and Factors Associated With the Morbidity Rate of Gonorrhea: A CDC-WONDER Database Analysis.,10.7759/cureus.42981,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gonorrhea is a prevalent sexually transmitted illness caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae, leading to serious health  consequences such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, ectopic  pregnancy, and increased susceptibility to HIV infection. Despite advancements in  prevention and treatment, gonorrhea remains a significant public health problem  in the United States (US) due to its widespread incidence, potential  consequences, and the growth of antibiotic resistance. This study investigates  the epidemiological trends and morbidity rates of gonorrhea using the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic  Research (WONDER) database. The aim is to identify temporal patterns, demographic  characteristics, and notable changes in gonorrhea epidemiology to inform targeted  therapies and interventions. METHODS: The CDC WONDER database, which provides  extensive national and state-level data on reported causes of death in the United  States, was utilized for this study. We examined the developments in gonorrhea  morbidity rates over time, identified demographic differences based on age,  gender, and race/ethnicity, and analyzed the disease's regional distribution  through a systematic analysis of the database. Aggregate data for selected time  periods (1996-2014) were summarized using the morbidity rate per 100,000 people  and the total number of cases across the years. RESULTS: This database analysis  identified a total of 6,454,097 individuals diagnosed with gonorrhea between 1996  and 2014. The calculated total morbidity rate during this period was 115.4 per  100,000 individuals. The highest morbidity rates were observed in the years 1999  (129.2 per 100,000 people), 1998 (129.1 per 100,000 people), and 2001 (126.8 per  100,000 people), respectively. The District of Columbia reported the highest  morbidity rate (478.25 per 100,000 people). In males, the overall morbidity rate  over the years was reported to be comparable to females (114 per 100,000 people  and 116.3 per 100,000 people, respectively). The analysis revealed consistently  higher morbidity rates among individuals aged between 19 and 24 years (525.2 per  100,000 people). Moreover, black or African American individuals consistently  exhibited higher morbidity rates (506.1 per 100,000 people) compared to white  individuals (16.1 per 100,000 people). CONCLUSION: The analysis of gonorrhea  cases between 1996 and 2014 revealed that the highest rates occurred during  specific years, with a particular concentration observed in the District of  Columbia. Additionally, certain demographic groups, such as individuals aged  19-24 and the black or African American population, consistently exhibited higher  morbidity rates compared to others. These findings emphasize the importance of  targeted interventions to address the observed temporal patterns and demographic  disparities, in order to effectively combat the spread of gonorrhea."
1,The natural history of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in women: a multi-parameter evidence synthesis,10.3310/hta20220,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The evidence base supporting the National Chlamydia Screening Programme, initiated in 2003, has been questioned repeatedly, with little consensus on modelling assumptions, parameter values or evidence sources to be used in cost-effectiveness analyses. The purpose of this project was to assemble all available evidence on the prevalence and incidence of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in the UK and its sequelae, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy (EP) and tubal factor infertility (TFI) to review the evidence base in its entirety, assess its consistency and, if possible, arrive at a coherent set of estimates consistent with all the evidence. METHODS: Evidence was identified using 'high-yield' strategies. Bayesian Multi-Parameter Evidence Synthesis models were constructed for separate subparts of the clinical and population epidemiology of CT. Where possible, different types of data sources were statistically combined to derive coherent estimates. Where evidence was inconsistent, evidence sources were re-interpreted and new estimates derived on a post-hoc basis. RESULTS: An internally coherent set of estimates was generated, consistent with a multifaceted evidence base, fertility surveys and routine UK statistics on PID and EP. Among the key findings were that the risk of PID (symptomatic or asymptomatic) following an untreated CT infection is 17.1% [95% credible interval (CrI) 6% to 29%] and the risk of salpingitis is 7.3% (95% CrI 2.2% to 14.0%). In women aged 16-24 years, screened at annual intervals, at best, 61% (95% CrI 55% to 67%) of CT-related PID and 22% (95% CrI 7% to 43%) of all PID could be directly prevented. For women aged 16-44 years, the proportions of PID, EP and TFI that are attributable to CT are estimated to be 20% (95% CrI 6% to 38%), 4.9% (95% CrI 1.2% to 12%) and 29% (95% CrI 9% to 56%), respectively. The prevalence of TFI in the UK in women at the end of their reproductive lives is 1.1%: this is consistent with all PID carrying a relatively high risk of reproductive damage, whether diagnosed or not. Every 1000 CT infections in women aged 16-44 years, on average, gives rise to approximately 171 episodes of PID and 73 of salpingitis, 2.0 EPs and 5.1 women with TFI at age 44 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS: The study establishes a set of interpretations of the major studies and study designs, under which a coherent set of estimates can be generated. CT is a significant cause of PID and TFI. CT screening is of benefit to the individual, but detection and treatment of incident infection may be more beneficial. Women with lower abdominal pain need better advice on when to seek early medical attention to avoid risk of reproductive damage. The study provides new insights into the reproductive risks of PID and the role of CT. Further research is required on the proportions of PID, EP and TFI attributable to CT to confirm predictions made in this report, and to improve the precision of key estimates. The cost-effectiveness of screening should be re-evaluated using the findings of this report. FUNDING: The Medical Research Council grant G0801947."
0,Detection of genital mycoplasmal infections among infertile females by multiplex PCR,,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Women reproductive system is a suitable environment for growth of various pathogen and nonpathogenic microorganisms. Mycoplasmataceae is a family of bacteria which cause oligosymptomatic genital infections. The complications caused by these bacteria may lead to infertility in women. The aim of this study was detection of genital Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasmaurealyticum and Mycoplasma genitalium among infertile females who referred to the infertility clinics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 104 infertile women (in reproductive age) who referred to infertility clinics in the city of Sanandaj, Kurdistan, Iran, from February to May 2013 were selected for this study. Cervical swabs were collected from all patients. The presence of genital Mycoplasmas was detected by multiplex-PCR. All data were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Out of 104 patients, 39 cases (37.5%) were infected with U. urealyticum. Mycuplasma. genitalium and M. homimis were detected in 3 (2.9%) of the infertile women. Co-infection was seen in 3.8% of the patients. There was no statistically the infections and patient age, educational levels, literacy, situation of employment, age of first significant sexual intercourse, history of abortion, type of infertility and infertility duration (p value > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data showed a low percentage of infection for M. genitalium and M. hominis in the studied women while the prevalence of U. urealyticum was high. Despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may have genital mycoplasmas in the cervix. We concluded that multiplex PCR using a pair of primers is a useful and cost-effective method for diagnosis of female genital infections."
0,Laboratory detection of bacterial pathogens and clinical and laboratory response of syndromic management in patients with cervical discharge: A retrospective  study.,10.25259/IJDVL_506_2021,"Background Cervical discharge as part of cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease is a cause of significant morbidity in sexually active women worldwide.  Non-gonococcal and non- chlamydial bacterial pathogens are becoming more  prevalent. Aims This study aims to determine bacterial pathogens causing cervical  discharge using culture and/or polymerase chain reaction and assess the clinical  and laboratory response to the conventional syndromic kit regimen established by  the World Health Organisation. Methods A retrospective review of records of women  with cervical discharge over one year period. Culture and/or polymerase chain  reaction results of endocervical swabs of various bacterial pathogens at baseline  and after four weeks of treatment with syndromic kit regimen were recorded.  Results A total of 70 case records were reviewed for clinical details, out of  which results of bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction were available  for 67 cases. Infectious aetiology was found in 30 (44.7%) patients with  Ureaplasma species being the most common organism isolated on culture (18, 26.8%)  and polymerase chain reaction (25, 37.3%), respectively. Polymerase chain  reaction for Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis was positive in ten  (14.9%) and four (6%) cases, respectively. None of the patients showed positive  culture for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Coinfection was seen in eight (11.9%) patients  with the majority showing Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma spp. coinfection  (five patients). Forty one cases (58.5%) received tab. cefixime 400 mg and tab.  azithromycin one gram stat (kit 1), while 29 cases (43.3%) received tab. cefixime  400 mg stat, tab. metronidazole 400 mg and cap. doxycycline 100 mg, both twice  daily for 14 days (kit 6). Minimal to no clinical improvement with treatment was  seen in 14 out of 32 cases (44%) at the end of four weeks with the conventional  kit regimen. Post-treatment culture and/or polymerase chain reaction were  positive in nine out of 28 cases (32.1%) with Ureaplasma spp. being the most  common. Limitations Retrospective study design, small sample size and fewer cases  with follow-up data were the main limitations. Conclusion Ureaplasma spp. was the  most common infectious cause of cervical discharge in our patients. Treatment  given as part of syndromic management led to a clinical and microbiological  response in around half and two-third cases, respectively."
0,High rates of chlamydia found among 12- to 16-year-olds attending a rural sexual health clinic: implications for practice,10.1071/SH15140,"Background Chlamydia is the most commonly diagnosed bacterial sexually transmissible infection (STI) and is asymptomatic in ~80% of women. If untreated, potential consequences include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility. METHODS: In 2014, a retrospective audit was undertaken at a rural service to determine what proportion of patients were aged 12-16 years, infected with chlamydia and their reasons for attending the clinic. RESULTS: There were 111 patients aged 12-16 years attending during 2011-2014; 104 (95%) were female. One hundred and ninety-four chlamydia tests were conducted, with the proportion of patients having at least one test annually being 100% in 2011, 81% in 2012, 72% in 2013 and 78% in 2014. There was no difference in the proportion tested by age during the study (P=0.59). Forty-six tests were positive for chlamydia (23.7%; 95%CI: 17.8%, 30.9%) with proportions decreasing with increasing age from 46.7% (95%CI: 16.4%, 79.5%) in 12- or 13-year-olds to 15.5% (95%CI: 9.4%, 24.2%) in 16-year-olds (P=0.02). The reasons for attending when a chlamydia test was ordered included: (i) fear of pregnancy (18.3%, 34/185); (ii) symptoms (16.7%, 31/185); (iii) STI test/treatment (32.4%, 60/185); and (iv) contraception (32.4%, 60/185). Only 29.7% (33/111) would have been tested if symptoms or requesting a test were impetus. CONCLUSION: Sexually active 12- to 16-year-olds should be tested for chlamydia, and establishing their sexual history is crucial. Amending the current Australian guidelines to annual testing of any sexually active person under the age of 30 years should be considered."
1,High chlamydia and gonorrhoea repeat positivity in remote Aboriginal communities 2009-2011: longitudinal analysis of testing for re-infection at 3 months suggests the need for more frequent screening,10.1071/SH16025,"Background Extremely high rates of diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) have been recorded in remote communities across northern and central Australia. Re-testing at 3 months, after treatment administered, of CT or NG is recommended to detect repeat infections and prevent morbidity and ongoing transmission. METHODS: Baseline CT and NG laboratory data (2009-2010) from 65 remote health services participating in a cluster randomised trial was used to calculate the proportion of individuals re-tested after an initial CT or NG diagnosis at <2 months (not recommended), 2-4 months (recommended) and 5-12 months and the proportion with repeat positivity on re-test. To assess if there were difference in re-testing and repeat positivity by age group and sex, t-tests were used. RESULTS: There was a total of 2054 people diagnosed with CT and/or NG in the study period; 14.9% were re-tested at 2-4 months, 26.9% at 5-12 months, a total of 41.8% overall. Re-testing was higher in females than in males in both the 2-4-month (16.9% v. 11.5%, P<0.01) and 5-12-month (28.9% v. 23.5%, P=0.01) periods. Women aged 25-29 years had a significantly higher level of re-testing 5-12 months post-diagnosis than females aged 16-19 years (39.8% v. 25.4%, P<0.01). There was a total of 858 people re-tested at 2-12 months and repeat positivity was 26.7%. There was higher repeat NG positivity than repeat CT positivity (28.8% v. 18.1%, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Just under half the individuals diagnosed with CT or NG were re-tested at 2-12 months post-diagnosis; however, only 15% were re-tested in the recommended time period of 2-4 months. The higher NG repeat positivity compared with CT is important, as repeat NG infections have been associated with higher risk of pelvic inflammatory disease-related hospitalisation. Findings have implications for clinical practice in remote community settings and will inform ongoing sexual health quality improvement programs in remote community clinics."
0,Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome Caused by Gonococcal Infection in a Patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematous: A Case Report and Literature Review,10.12659/ajcr.906393,"BACKGROUND Fitz-Hugh-Curtis (FHC) syndrome is a perihepatitis linked to inflammatory pelvic disease. It can be caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis infections. FHC syndrome usually presents with pain in the right hypochondrium and fever, associated with symptoms and signs of pelvic infection in women. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 22-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) who presented with polyarthritis, cutaneous lesions, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of FHC syndrome was based on the findings of abdominal computerized tomography (CT) and the isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in blood cultures. The association of arthritis and cutaneous lesions was diagnosed as a syndrome of arthritis-dermatitis, also caused by systemic NG infection. The patient had a favorable outcome with antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS FHC syndrome should be considered in sexually active young patients, mainly women, with pelvic infection and perihepatitis. It may be caused by disseminated gonococcal infection. An important risk factor is the serum complement deficit, which may predispose to severe forms. Low serum complement level is a frequent manifestation of active SLE. CT images showing the typical findings of perihepatitis allow making the correct diagnosis."
0,Management of gonorrhoea in a hospital network: are we following best practice?,10.1071/SH19018,"Background Gonorrhoea is usually managed in community sexual health or general practice, but a proportion of cases present to hospital settings. In this study, we examined how gonorrhoea was managed through a large hospital network and what the implications may be for public health management. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of the management of patients with Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection diagnosed at a large Australian healthcare network from January 2015 to May 2018. Documentation rates of five parameters of care were assessed: (1) the presence (or absence) of previous sexually transmissible infections (STIs); (2) recent travel; (3) discussion of HIV testing; (4) contact tracing; and (5) public health notification. RESULTS: In all, 110 cases (48 male, 62 female) were analysed. Most cases were in the 15-39 years age group; 98 cases (89%) were symptomatic, and 12 (11%) were screening tests. The most common presenting syndromes were pelvic inflammatory disease (32%; 31/98 symptomatic cases), urethritis (26%; 25/98) and epididymo-orchitis (13%; 13/98). None of the five parameters assessed were documented in most cases. Documentation was most likely to occur in patients admitted to hospital. When HIV testing was performed, no new cases of HIV were identified. CONCLUSION: Infections with gonorrhoea present on a regular basis to hospital practice, but overall management is suboptimal. Automated prompts for other recommended tests, including HIV testing when testing for other sexually transmissible diseases is ordered, may improve management. Better awareness of best practice is needed, which can be facilitated with ongoing education. However, the greatest benefit is likely achieved by linking patients back to community-based services, which are best placed to provide ongoing long-term care."
1,Diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease and barriers to conducting pelvic examinations in Australian general practice: findings from an online survey,10.1071/SH20176,"Background Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is under-diagnosed globally, particularly in primary care, and if untreated may cause reproductive complications. This paper investigates PID diagnosis by Australian general practitioners (GPs) and barriers to their conducting a pelvic examination. METHODS: An online survey investigating Australian GPs' chlamydia management, including PID diagnosis, was conducted in 2019. From 323 respondents, 85.8% (n = 277) answered multiple-choice questions about PID and 74.6% (n = 241) answered a free-text question about barriers to conducting pelvic examinations. Using multivariable logistic regression, we identified factors associated with conducting pelvic examinations. Barriers to performing pelvic examinations were explored using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Most GPs indicated that they routinely ask female patients with a sexually transmissible infection about PID symptoms, including pelvic pain (86.2%), abnormal vaginal discharge (95.3%), abnormal vaginal bleeding (89.5%), and dyspareunia (79.6%). Over half reported routinely conducting speculum (69.0%) and bimanual pelvic (55.3%) examinations for women reporting pelvic pain. Female GPs were more likely to perform speculum [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.6; 95%CI: 2.6-8.2] and bimanual pelvic examinations (AOR 3.7; 95%CI: 2.1-6.5). GPs with additional sexual health training were more likely to routinely perform speculum (AOR 2.2; 95%CI: 1.1-4.2) and bimanual pelvic examinations (AOR 2.1; 95%CI: 1.2-3.7). Barriers to pelvic examinations were patient unwillingness and/or refusal, GP gender, patient health-related factors, time pressures, and GP reluctance. CONCLUSION: Although GPs typically ask about PID symptoms when managing patients with chlamydia, they are not consistently able or willing to perform pelvic examinations to support a diagnosis, potentially reducing capacity to diagnose PID."
1,Pelvic inflammatory disease associated with Chlamydia trachomatis but not Mycoplasma genitalium in New Zealand,10.1071/SH14238,"Background There is a paucity of studies looking at associations between Mycoplasma genitalium and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of M. genitalium in women attending a sexual health service in New Zealand and secondly to examine for an association of M. genitalium with PID. METHODS: Women consecutively attending the service for a sexual health screen (Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis) were recruited to establish a baseline prevalence of M. genitalium. An extra cervical swab was taken for the detection of M. genitalium. Recruitment of additional women with a clinical diagnosis of PID continued until a sufficient sample size was obtained to examine the association of PID with M. genitalium. Women in the baseline sample without PID were used as the control group. RESULTS: The control group included 250 women, with M. genitalium diagnosed in 8.7% (95% CI 5.8-12.9%) and C. trachomatis in 9.9% (95% CI 6.8-14.2%). Ninety-one women were recruited with PID; M. genitalium was diagnosed in 9.9% (95% CI 5.3-17.7%) and C. trachomatis in 27.5% (95% CI 19.4-37.4%). Multivariate analysis using clinically relevant variables showed that a diagnosis of C. trachomatis (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.24-4.81) but not M. genitalium (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.38-2.20) was significantly associated with a PID diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: M. genitalium was almost as commonly diagnosed as C. trachomatis in this population. C. trachomatis was the only infection that was significantly associated with PID."
1,Adolescent women with sexually transmitted infections: who gets lost to follow-up?,10.1016/j.jemermed.2014.06.022,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent patients comprise the highest rate of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in the United States. These patients often initially present to the emergency department (ED) with vague symptoms. OBJECTIVES: 1) Quantify the frequency of underrecognized GC and CT cervical infections in adolescent women tested in the ED; 2) describe and compare the characteristics of those treated and not treated during the initial visit; and 3) quantify the delay interval until treatment was provided. METHODS: This was a retrospective, cohort analysis of consecutive females (ages 13-19 years) seen at four academic medical centers over a 36-month period with positive results for GC/CT. Our key outcome measures were the proportion of adolescent females being untreated in the ED, the time to subsequent treatment, and the proportion lost to follow-up. RESULTS: During the study period, 382 female adolescents had positive polymerase chain reaction studies for GC or CT or both; 266 (70%) were not treated in the ED. Untreated patients were significantly more likely to have a discharge diagnosis of urinary tract infection (23% vs. 11%, p < 0.008), new pregnancy (29% vs. 8%, p < 0.001), and vaginitis (24.8% vs. 5%, p < 0.001). Subsequently, only 11.7% (31/266) of the untreated patients fit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for empiric treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease. After telephone, mail, and public health follow-up, treatment could be documented for only 59% of the patients. CONCLUSION: The majority of adolescent women found to have GC or CT or both in the ED were not treated at presentation."
0,RNA Biosignatures in Adolescent Patients in a Pediatric Emergency Department With Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,10.1097/PEC.0000000000000483,"BACKGROUND: Adolescents are at high risk for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Because accurate diagnosis of PID is difficult, and complications of untreated PID are significant, novel methods to improve diagnosis are essential. OBJECTIVES: To determine if patients with PID have unique RNA expression patterns compared to controls. METHODS: Peripheral blood was collected from adolescent females with PID in the emergency department, and from control patients in the operating room. RNA was isolated, and microarray analysis was performed. Initial analysis involved a training set of 18 patients (9 PID patients with either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis infection and 9 control patients). Supervised and unsupervised cluster analyses were performed, followed by network analysis. The training set was used to classify a set of 15 additional PID patients and 2 controls. RESULTS: Supervised cluster analysis of the training set revealed 170 genes which were differentially expressed in PID patients versus controls. Network analysis indicated that several differentially expressed genes are involved in immune activation. Analysis of additional PID patients based on the training set findings revealed that patients with positive testing for Trichomonas vaginalis partitioned with the PID group, whereas patients with no organism identified partitioned with both groups. CONCLUSIONS: RNA sample collection from adolescents in the emergency department is feasible. Genes were identified which were differentially expressed in PID patients versus controls, many of which are involved in inflammation. Future studies should confirm the training set findings on a larger sample and may lead to improved accuracy of PID diagnosis."
0,Severe Sepsis and Acute Myocardial Dysfunction in an Adolescent with Chlamydia Trachomatis Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: A Case Report,10.1016/j.jpag.2017.10.004,"BACKGROUND: Although generally asymptomatic, severe Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infections have been documented. C. trachomatis has been associated with myocarditis as well as sepsis. CASE: A 19-year-old girl with type 1 diabetes mellitus developed sudden-onset mental status change and shock after resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis. Abdominal and pelvic imaging showed uterine and adnexal inflammation, and pelvic examination confirmed a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. The patient was intubated, required vasopressor support, and developed severe biventricular myocardial dysfunction. Infectious myocarditis workup was negative. Nucleic acid amplification testing from vaginal discharge was positive for C. trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis and negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: C. trachomatis should be considered in the workup of septic shock, particularly in populations at high risk for sexually transmitted infections."
0,Human papillomavirus 16/18 seroprevalence in unvaccinated women over 30 years with normal cytology and with high grade cervical abnormalities in Australia: results from an observational study,10.1186/s12879-014-0676-z,"BACKGROUND: Australia commenced human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in 2007, with a two-year catch-up to the age of 26; catch-up cohorts are thus now entering their thirties. Plans for monitoring vaccine impact involve pre- and post-vaccination assessment of cervical HPV DNA in the general population and in high grade abnormalities. Although HPV serology is less sensitive than DNA genotyping, it assesses lifetime exposure and may be easier to measure in the general population. However, benchmark pre-vaccination seroprevalence of vaccine-included types in unvaccinated women with high grade abnormalities has not previously been reported. METHODS: We assessed seroprevalence for HPV16/18 from a population-based sample of 3,729 women with normal cytology and 971 women with confirmed high grade abnormalities (CIN2/3), aged 30-64 years, unvaccinated, and recruited in New South Wales in 2006-2010. We examined the variation in HPV16/18 seropositivity by age and in relation to a range of reproductive and behavioural characteristics in the subgroup of normal cytology women with no recent history of high grade cervical disease. RESULTS: The HPV 16, 18 and combined seroprevalence was 19%, 7% and 24% among women with normal cytology, and 39%, 13% and 44% among women with CIN2/3, respectively. For both groups, HPV16/18 seroprevalence was highest at age 30-39 years and decreased with age. In multivariable analysis for women with normal cytology, HPV16 and HPV18 seropositivity were each associated with the number of lifetime sexual partners (p-trend <0.001 and 0.052, respectively) and for HPV16 this was also associated with age (p-trend <0.001) and prior diagnosis of Chlamydia (adjusted OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.27-2.80). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study inform pre-vaccination estimates of HPV seropositivity in women with normal cytology and women with high grade abnormalities. Almost a quarter of unvaccinated women aged over 30 years with normal cytology, and more than 40% of those with CIN2/3, had seroconverted to HPV 16 or 18. These findings provide a potential additional benchmark for assessing the effects of HPV vaccination."
0,Prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium infection in women with bacterial vaginosis,10.1186/s12905-020-00926-6,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in reproductive-age women and is known to be positively associated with risk of acquisition of sexually transmitted infections (STI) such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. Mycoplasma genitalium is an emerging STI that has been linked to increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes and infertility. In the present study we sought to examine whether women diagnosed with symptomatic BV were at increased risk of having concurrent infection with Mycoplasma genitalium. METHODS: We used a novel PCR-based assay (ResistancePlus MG; SpeeDx Pty. Ltd., Sydney, Australia) to determine the prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium infection and 23S rRNA macrolide-resistance mediating mutations (MRMM) in a cohort of 1532 women presenting with symptoms of vaginitis. RESULTS: M. genitalium was detected in 4.0% (62/1532) of samples with 37.1% (23/62) harboring MRMMs. The prevalence of M. genitalium infection in subjects with BV was significantly higher than in subjects with non-BV vaginitis (7.0% v 3.6%; OR = 1.97 (95% CI: 1.14-3.39). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of M. genitalium infection is associated with BV in women with symptomatic vaginitis. Improved management of BV is needed as a component of STI prevention strategies."
1,Physician Specialty Influences Care of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,10.1089/jwh.2015.5349,"BACKGROUND: CDC guidelines recommend Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and HIV testing, as well as specific antibiotic regimens in the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), although latitude in adhering to these guidelines is common. We hypothesized that adherence to CDC guidelines for antibiotic regimens and laboratory testing, coverage for anaerobic organisms, and the use of diagnostic imaging techniques do not differ significantly between practitioners with emergency medicine (EM) versus obstetrics and gynecology (OB-GYN) training. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective medical chart review on patients (N = 351) discharged with a diagnosis of PID over a 20-month period at two neighboring emergency care facilities-one with EM-trained providers and the other with OB-GYN-trained providers. RESULTS: Adjusted for demographic predictors and chief complaint, there was no significant difference in adherence to N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis antibiotic coverage guidelines between the two facilities (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.34; 95% CI 0.66-2.74), using the OB-GYN facility in the numerator of the AOR. Anaerobic coverage was significantly more common at the OB-GYN facility (AOR 9.11; 95% CI 5.36-15.48). Both sites had very low rates of adherence to CDC laboratory testing guidelines with overall rates of adherence at 4.0% (95% CI 1.9%-5.9%). Utilization of diagnostic tests differed greatly between facilities: ultrasound utilization was 66.7% (95% CI 58.2%-75.2%) at the OB-GYN facility and 39.7% (95% CI 33.4%-45.9%) at the EM facility. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic pathway for PID and adherence to guidelines differ significantly depending on physician specialty and practice environment, suggesting the need for further standardization, perhaps with cross-disciplinary training."
0,Human papillomavirus genotypes distribution among Gabonese women with normal cytology and cervical abnormalities,10.1186/s13027-016-0046-0,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the most common tumors affecting women with a disproportionate mortality occurring in developing countries. Despite the high prevalence of cervical cancer and cervical neoplasia in Gabon, few studies have been performed to evaluate the prevalence and determinants of HPV infection in this country. The aim of this study was to determine the HPV prevalence and distribution in a population of Gabonese women with normal cytology and cervical abnormalities. METHODS: A total of 200 cervical samples collected in the ""Departement d'Anatomie et de Cytologie Pathologiques"" of the ""Faculté de Medecine et des Sciences de la Santé"" in Libreville, Gabonwere analyzed. Cytological status was classified according to Bethesda 2001. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using consensus degenerate PCR primers (MY09/11 and GP5+/6+) was performed for the detection of HPV DNA and HPV typing was done by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Cytological analysis showed that 87 % of women had normal cytology (n = 174/200). Among the 26 women with cytological abnormalities, predominance (61.5 %; 16/26) of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) was found and no cervical cancer case was detected. Overall, HPV DNA was detected in 60 % of women (120/200). With respect to the cytological status, HPV DNA was found in 57.5 % of women with normal cervix and 76.9 % of women with abnormal cytology. HPV genotyping was performed on 114 HPV positive cases and revealed the presence of 11 distinct genotypes: 16, 18, 33, 31, 56, 6, 66, 70, 35, 45 and 81. The high risk type HPV 16 was the most common genotype found in all cytological categories. Six HPV positive samples could not be typed by DNA sequencing, probably due to multiple HPV infection. Evaluation of possible risk factors showed that HPV infection was related positively with number of sexual partners (≥3, OR = 2.3; 95 % CI, 1.3-4.3), history of sexually transmitted infection (Chlamydia, OR = 1.9; 95 % CI, 1.01-3.4) and marital status (single, OR = 2.0; 95 % CI, 1.1-3.5). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HPV infection among Gabonese women is high. Our findings highlight the need to set up a national program to fight cervical cancer, combining Pap smear test and HPV testing, to improve cervical cancer prevention in Gabon."
1,"Assessing Trends in Chlamydia Positivity and Gonorrhea Incidence and Their Associations With the Incidence of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease and Ectopic Pregnancy in Washington State, 1988-2010",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000352,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia and gonorrhea screening for women is beneficial if it prevents serious reproductive sequelae, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and ectopic pregnancy (EP). We assessed trends in PID and EP among women in Washington and their association with gonorrhea incidence and chlamydia positivity in a screened population of women over a 23 year period. METHODS: Using data on chlamydia positivity from the Infertility Prevention Project, gonorrhea incidence from state surveillance, and PID and EP hospitalizations from hospital discharge records, we assessed trends in each condition over time. In addition, we estimated total incidence of PID and EP by incorporating information on outpatient-treated cases in alternative populations using a Bayesian approach that accounted for uncertainty in the estimates. We assessed associations between each infection and PID/EP using a linear regression model that accounts for year-to-year correlation in data points. RESULTS: We observed substantial declines in both infections and in each outcome over time. For every 2% decrease in chlamydia positivity, there was a 35.7/100,000 decrease in estimated total PID incidence (P = 0.058) and 184.4/100,000 decrease in estimated total EP (P = 0.149). For every 32/100,000 decline in gonorrhea incidence, there was a 16.5/100,000 decrease in total PID (P = 0.292) and 159.8/100,000 decrease in total EP (P = 0.020). The associations with inpatient PID and EP were highly significant for both chlamydia and gonorrhea. CONCLUSIONS: These ecological data note concurrent and substantial declines in chlamydia positivity and gonorrhea incidence, and in PID and EP incidence in Washington from 1988 to 2010 during a time when widespread chlamydia screening was ongoing."
0,The use of direct immunofluorescence and nested polymerase chain reaction in diagnosing perinatal infections of Chlamydia trachomatis,10.17219/acem/75724,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia infection is the most frequently reported infectious, sexually transmitted disease (STD). Generally, Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infection of neonates is the result of perinatal exposure to the mother's infected cervix. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to estimate the frequency of infection caused by C. trachomatis in newborn infants. In this study of C. trachomatis perinatal infection, 107 infants born at the Wroclaw Medical University Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Poland) were tested to investigate whether C. trachomatis was present in swabs taken from the eyes and throats of children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Each specimen was tested using the direct immunofluorescence test (DIF) and the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. RESULTS: The presence of C. trachomatis, irrespective of the origin of the swabs (ocular or from the throat), was confirmed in 62 newborns, amounting to 57.6% of the tested population. The occurrence of C. trachomatis in ocular swabs was confirmed in 35 children (32.7%). In the material taken from the throat, there were 48 newborns considered chlamydia-positive (44.9%). In the specimens taken from both the ocular and pharyngeal locations, there was a higher proportion of positive results while using the nested-PCR method in comparison to the DIF test. The specificity of the DIF method with reference to the nested-PCR was 67.9% for ocular swabs. In the material taken from the throat, the sensitivity of the DIF method with reference to the nested-PCR was 75.0% and the specificity was 62.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the importance of perinatal infections, it is recommended to perform a study among a larger group of patients in order to gain more reliable results."
0,'It Opened My Eyes'-examining the impact of a multifaceted chlamydia testing intervention on general practitioners using Normalization Process Theory,10.1093/fampra/cmy011,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia is the most common notifiable sexually transmissible infection in Australia. Left untreated, it can develop into pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. The majority of notifications come from general practice and it is ideally situated to test young Australians. OBJECTIVES: The Australian Chlamydia Control Effectiveness Pilot (ACCEPt) was a multifaceted intervention that aimed to reduce chlamydia prevalence by increasing testing in 16- to 29-year-olds attending general practice. GPs were interviewed to describe the effectiveness of the ACCEPt intervention in integrating chlamydia testing into routine practice using Normalization Process Theory (NPT). METHODS: GPs were purposively selected based on age, gender, geographic location and size of practice at baseline and midpoint. Interview data were analysed regarding the intervention components and results were interpreted using NPT. RESULTS: A total of 44 GPs at baseline and 24 at midpoint were interviewed. Most GPs reported offering a test based on age at midpoint versus offering a test based on symptoms or patient request at baseline. Quarterly feedback was the most significant ACCEPt component for facilitating a chlamydia test. CONCLUSIONS: The ACCEPt intervention has been able to moderately normalize chlamydia testing among GPs, although the components had varying levels of effectiveness. NPT can demonstrate the effective implementation of an intervention in general practice and has been valuable in understanding which components are essential and which components can be improved upon."
0,Impact and cost-effectiveness of chlamydia testing in Scotland: a mathematical modelling study,10.1186/1742-4682-12-2,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection in Scotland, and is associated with potentially serious reproductive outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and tubal factor infertility (TFI) in women. Chlamydia testing in Scotland is currently targeted towards symptomatic individuals, individuals at high risk of existing undetected infection, and young people. The cost-effectiveness of testing and treatment to prevent PID and TFI in Scotland is uncertain. METHODS: A compartmental deterministic dynamic model of chlamydia infection in 15-24 year olds in Scotland was developed. The model was used to estimate the impact of a change in testing strategy from baseline (16.8% overall testing coverage; 0.4 partners notified and tested/treated per treated positive index) on PID and TFI cases. Cost-effectiveness calculations informed by best-available estimates of the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to PID and TFI were also performed. RESULTS: Increasing overall testing coverage by 50% from baseline to 25.2% is estimated to result in 21% fewer cases in young women each year (PID: 703 fewer; TFI: 88 fewer). A 50% decrease to 8.4% would result in 20% more PID (669 additional) and TFI (84 additional) cases occurring annually. The cost per QALY gained of current testing activities compared to no testing is £40,034, which is above the £20,000-£30,000 cost-effectiveness threshold. However, calculations are hampered by lack of reliable data. Any increase in partner notification from baseline would be cost-effective (incremental cost per QALY gained for a partner notification efficacy of 1 compared to baseline: £5,119), and would increase the cost-effectiveness of current testing strategy compared to no testing, with threshold cost-effectiveness reached at a partner notification efficacy of 1.5. However, there is uncertainty in the extent to which partner notification is currently done, and hence the amount by which it could potentially be increased. CONCLUSIONS: Current chlamydia testing strategy in Scotland is not cost-effective under the conservative model assumptions applied. However, with better data enabling some of these assumptions to be relaxed, current coverage could be cost-effective. Meanwhile, increasing partner notification efficacy on its own would be a cost-effective way of preventing PID and TFI from current strategy."
1,New best practice guidance for general practice to reduce chlamydia-associated reproductive complications in women,10.31128/AJGP-04-20-5330,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia is the most commonly diagnosed bacterial sexually transmissible infection (STI) in Australia, with most infections diagnosed and managed in general practice. Often asymptomatic, left untreated it can cause serious reproductive complications in women. There is now global recognition of the importance of enhanced chlamydia case management to reduce the risk of repeat infection and minimise harms of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide evidence-based information and resources to help general practitioners engage in partner management and retesting as part of routine STI care, in accordance with Australia's Fourth National Sexually Transmissible Infections Strategy: 2018-2022, and to provide up-to-date evidence about anorectal chlamydia and other emerging concerns in women. DISCUSSION: Evidence-based information and strategies for partner management and retesting the index case are provided in this article, in addition to information regarding the detection of PID, screening and treatment of anorectal chlamydia, antimicrobial resistance, and testing and treatment in pregnancy."
0,"Costs, Health Benefits, and Cost-Effectiveness of Chlamydia Screening and Partner Notification in the United States, 2000-2019: A Mathematical Modeling Analysis.",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001786,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia remains a significant public health problem that contributes to adverse reproductive health outcomes. In the United States,  sexually active women 24 years and younger are recommended to receive annual  screening for chlamydia. In this study, we evaluated the impact of estimated  current levels of screening and partner notification (PN), and the impact of  screening based on guidelines on chlamydia associated sequelae, quality adjusted  life years (QALYs) lost and costs. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness  analysis of chlamydia screening, using a published calibrated pair formation  transmission model that estimated trends in chlamydia screening coverage in the  United States from 2000 to 2015 consistent with epidemiological data. We used  probability trees to translate chlamydial infection outcomes into estimated  numbers of chlamydia-associated sequelae, QALYs lost, and health care services  costs (in 2020 US dollars). We evaluated the costs and population health benefits  of screening and PN in the United States for 2000 to 2015, as compared with no  screening and no PN. We also estimated the additional benefits that could be  achieved by increasing screening coverage to the levels indicated by the policy  recommendations for 2016 to 2019, compared with screening coverage achieved by  2015. RESULTS: Screening and PN from 2000 to 2015 were estimated to have averted  1.3 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 490,000-2.3 million) cases of pelvic  inflammatory disease, 430,000 (95% UI, 160,000-760,000) cases of chronic pelvic  pain, 300,000 (95% UI, 104,000-570,000) cases of tubal factor infertility, and  140,000 (95% UI, 47,000-260,000) cases of ectopic pregnancy in women. We  estimated that chlamydia screening and PN cost $9700 per QALY gained compared  with no screening and no PN. We estimated the full realization of chlamydia  screening guidelines for 2016 to 2019 to cost $30,000 per QALY gained, compared  with a scenario in which chlamydia screening coverage was maintained at 2015  levels. DISCUSSION: Chlamydia screening and PN as implemented in the United  States from 2000 through 2015 has substantially improved population health and  provided good value for money when considering associated health care services  costs. Further population health gains are attainable by increasing screening  further, at reasonable cost per QALY gained."
0,Outpatient sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment patterns in the United States: a real-world database study.,10.1186/s12879-023-08434-2,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) are the most common notifiable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United  States. Because symptoms of these infections often overlap with other urogenital  infections, misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment can occur unless appropriate STI  diagnostic testing is performed in clinical settings. The objective of this study  was to describe STI diagnostic testing and antimicrobial treatment patterns and  trends among adolescent and adult men and women with lower genitourinary tract  symptoms (LGUTS). METHODS: We analyzed insurance claims data from the IBM®  MarketScan® Research Databases. Patients included were between 14 and 64 years  old with LGUTS as determined by selected International Classification of Diseases  codes between January 2010 and December 2019. Testing of STIs and relevant drug  claims were captured, and distribution of testing patterns and drug claims were  described. RESULTS: In total, 23,537,812 episodes with LGUTS (87.4% from women;  12.6% from men) were analyzed from 12,341,154 patients. CT/NG testing occurred in  only 17.6% of all episodes. For episodes where patients received treatment within  2 weeks of the visit date, 89.3% received treatment within the first 3 days  (likely indicating presumptive treatment), and 77.7% received it on the first  day. For women with pelvic inflammatory disease and men with  orchitis/epididymitis and acute prostatitis, ≤ 15% received CT/NG testing, and  around one-half received antibiotic treatment within 3 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our  study revealed low CT/NG testing rates, even in patients diagnosed with  complications commonly associated with these STIs, along with high levels of  potentially inappropriate presumptive treatment. This highlights the need for  timely and accurate STI diagnosis in patients with LGUTS to inform appropriate  treatment recommendations."
0,Host Genetic Risk Factors for Chlamydia trachomatis-Related Infertility in Women,10.1093/infdis/jiab149,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infection ascending to the upper genital tract can cause infertility. Direct association of genetic variants as contributors is challenging because infertility may not be diagnosed until years after infection. Investigating the intermediate trait of ascension bridges this gap. METHODS: We identified infertility genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci using deoxyribonucleic acid from Ct-seropositive cisgender women in a tubal factor infertility study and Ct-infected cisgender women from a longitudinal pelvic inflammatory disease cohort with known fertility status. Deoxyribonucleic acid and blood messenger ribonucleic acid from 2 additional female cohorts with active Ct infection and known endometrial infection status were used to investigate the impact of infertility single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on Ct ascension. A statistical mediation test examined whether multiple infertility SNPs jointly influenced ascension risk by modulating expression of mediator genes. RESULTS: We identified 112 candidate infertility GWAS loci, and 31 associated with Ct ascension. The SNPs altered chlamydial ascension by modulating expression of 40 mediator genes. Mediator genes identified are involved in innate immune responses including type I interferon production, T-cell function, fibrosis, female reproductive tract health, and protein synthesis and degradation. CONCLUSIONS: We identified Ct-related infertility loci and their potential functional effects on Ct ascension."
0,Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of Chlamydia trachomatis infection among sexually transmitted infection clinics patients,10.1016/j.eimce.2022.04.001,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections are a public health problem because of its high incidence and consequences on reproductive health. Our aim is to describe the socio-demographic, behavioral and clinical characteristics of patients with CT infection in order to adapt preventive interventions for the highest risk groups. METHODS: Prospective case series of all patients diagnosed with CT between September 2016 and January 2019 in the reference STI clinics of Osakidetza (Basque Health Service) in Bizkaia (Spain). RESULTS: 847 patients (88.2%) agreed to participate: 41% women, 33.8% heterosexual men and 25% men who has sex with men (MSM); 33% were immigrants and 26% were under the age of 25 (33% of the women). Only 20% systematically used condoms. 36% had previously had STI and 28% had simultaneously another STI. 55% of the infections were asymptomatic (70% among women). In MSM, the rectum was affected in 69.5% of cases, the urethra in 31.4%, and the pharynx in 14.5%. The cervix was affected in 86.5% of the women, the rectum in 17.6%, and the pharynx in 13.8%. A contact study was only carried out in 58% of cases. The reinfection rate at 4 weeks was 17% among those with criteria to perform a test of cure. CONCLUSION: Our results justify implement opportunistic screening in women under the age of 25 and young immigrants of both sexes, by taking genital and extragenital samples, as well as developing appropriate guidelines for the notification and follow-up of contacts."
1,The Netherlands Chlamydia cohort study (NECCST) protocol to assess the risk of late complications following Chlamydia trachomatis infection in women,10.1186/s12879-017-2376-y,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) among young women, can result in serious sequelae. Although the course of infection is often asymptomatic, CT may cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), leading to severe complications, such as prolonged time to pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal factor subfertility. The risk of and risk factors for complications following CT-infection have not been assessed in a long-term prospective cohort study, the preferred design to define infections and complications adequately. METHODS: In the Netherlands Chlamydia Cohort Study (NECCST), a cohort of women of reproductive age with and without a history of CT-infection is followed over a minimum of ten years to investigate (CT-related) reproductive tract complications. This study is a follow-up of the Chlamydia Screening Implementation (CSI) study, executed between 2008 and 2011 in the Netherlands. For NECCST, female CSI participants who consented to be approached for follow-up studies (n = 14,685) are invited, and prospectively followed until 2022. Four data collection moments are foreseen every two consecutive years. Questionnaire data and blood samples for CT-Immunoglobulin G (IgG) measurement are obtained as well as host DNA to determine specific genetic biomarkers related to susceptibility and severity of infection. CT-history will be based on CSI test outcomes, self-reported infections and CT-IgG presence. Information on (time to) pregnancies and the potential long-term complications (i.e. PID, ectopic pregnancy and (tubal factor) subfertility), will be acquired by questionnaires. Reported subfertility will be verified in medical registers. Occurrence of these late complications and prolonged time to pregnancy, as a proxy for reduced fertility due to a previous CT-infection, or other risk factors, will be investigated using longitudinal statistical procedures. DISCUSSION: In the proposed study, the occurrence of late complications following CT-infection and its risk factors will be assessed. Ultimately, provided reliable risk factors and/or markers can be identified for such late complications. This will contribute to the development of a prognostic tool to estimate the risk of CT-related complications at an early time point, enabling targeted prevention and care towards women at risk for late complications.

0,"Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections among pregnant women and eye colonization of their neonates at birth time, Shiraz, Southern Iran",10.1186/s12879-018-3382-4,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the two common transmissible pathogens from pregnant women to their neonates. Given the lack of routine screening and treatment of pregnant women in some areas, the possibility of transmission rises. This study seeks to determine the prevalence of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in the pregnant women with no clinical symptoms and the vertical transmission rate to their neonates. METHODS: The study was conducted on endocervical and eye swab samples of 239 pregnant women and their neonates. Identification was based on PCR method. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of C.trachomatis in women and neonates were 37/239 (15.5%) and 28/239 (11.7%), and for N. gonorrhoeae 3/239 (1.3%), 1/239 (0.4%), respectively. The vertical transmission rates to the neonates were 28/37(75.6%) for C. trachomatis and 1/3 for N. gonorrhoeae. CONCLUSIONS: In the areas with a high prevalence of chlamydial or gonococcal infections, and in the absence of screening and treatment of the pregnant women, ocular prophylaxis with antibiotics is suggested as a part of routine neonatal care program for the prevention of chlamydial and gonococcal ophthalmia."
0,Cervical Cytokines Associated With Chlamydia trachomatis Susceptibility and Protection,10.1093/infdis/jiz087,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis can cause reproductive morbidities after ascending to the upper genital tract of women, and repeated infection can lead to worse disease. Data related to protective immune responses at the cervical mucosa that could limit chlamydial infection to the cervix and/or prevent reinfection inform vaccine approaches and biomarkers of risk. METHODS: We measured 48 cytokines in cervical secretions from women having chlamydial cervical infection alone (n = 92) or both cervical and endometrial infection (n = 68). Univariable regression identified cytokines associated with differential odds of endometrial infection and reinfection risk, and multivariable stepwise regression identified cytokine ratios associated with differential risk. RESULTS: Elevated interleukin (IL) 15/CXCL10 (odds ratio [OR], 0.55 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .37-.78]), IL-16/tumor necrosis factor-α (OR, 0.66 [95% CI, .45-.93]), and CXCL14/IL-17A (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, .54-.97]) cytokine ratios were significantly (P ≤ .05) associated with decreased odds of endometrial infection. A higher Flt-3L/IL-14 ratio was significantly (P = .001) associated with a decreased risk of reinfection (hazard ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, .58-.88]). CONCLUSIONS: Cytokines involved in humoral, type I interferon, and T-helper (Th) 17 responses were associated with susceptibility to C. trachomatis, whereas cytokines involved in Th1 polarization, recruitment, and activation were associated with protection against ascension and reinfection."

Plasmid gene protein 3 antibody (Pgp3Ab) detects prior chlamydial infections. We evaluated for an association of high chlamydial seropositivity with sequelae using a Pgp3Ab multiplex bead array (Pgp3AbMBA). METHODS: We performed chlamydia Pgp3AbMBA on sera from women 18-39 years old participating in the 2013-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with urine chlamydia nucleic acid amplification test results. High chlamydial seropositivity was defined as a median fluorescence intensity (MFI ≥ 50 000; low-positive was MFI > 551-<50 000. Weighted US population high-positive, low-positive, and negative Pgp3Ab chlamydia seroprevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were compared for women with chlamydial infection, self-reported PID, and infertility. RESULTS: Of 2339 women aged 18-39 years, 1725 (73.7%) had sera, and 1425 were sexually experienced. Overall, 104 women had high positive Pgp3Ab (5.4% [95% CI 4.0-7.0] of US women); 407 had lowpositive Pgp3Ab (25.1% [95% CI 21.5-29.0]), and 914 had negative Pgp3Ab (69.5% [95% CI 65.5-73.4]). Among women with high Pgp3Ab, infertility prevalence was 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.7) times higher than among Pgp3Ab-negative women (19.6% [95% CI 10.5-31.7] versus 9.9% [95% CI 7.7-12.4]). For women with low Pgp3Ab, PID prevalence was 7.9% (95% CI 4.6-12.6) compared to 2.3% (95% CI 1.4-3.6) in negative Pgp3Ab. CONCLUSIONS: High chlamydial Pgp3Ab seropositivity was associated with infertility although small sample size limited evaluation of an association of high seropositivity with PID. In infertile women, Pgp3Ab may be a marker of prior chlamydial infection."
0,Analysis of Factors Driving Incident and Ascending Infection and the Role of Serum Antibody in Chlamydia trachomatis Genital Tract Infection,10.1093/infdis/jiv438,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis genital tract infection is a major cause of female reproductive morbidity. Risk factors for ascending infection are unknown, and the role for antibody in protection is not well established. METHODS: We recruited 225 women from urban outpatient clinics and followed them for a median of 12 months. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of serum anti-chlamydial immunoglobulin G (IgG), behavioral factors, and microbiological factors associated with endometrial infection at enrollment, and a longitudinal analysis of factors associated with incident infection. RESULTS: Oral contraceptives (adjusted relative risk [RR], 2.02 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.38-2.97]) and gonorrhea (adjusted RR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.07-2.60]) were associated with endometrial infection. Gonorrhea (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.09 [95% CI, 1.41-6.78]), cervical infection at enrollment (adjusted HR, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.07-5.11]), and exposure to uncircumcised partners (adjusted HR, 2.65 [95% CI, 1.21-5.82]) or infected partners (adjusted HR, 4.99 [95% CI, 2.66-9.39]) significantly increased the risk of incident infection. Seropositivity was associated with a reduced cervical burden (P < .05) but no differences in rates of ascending infection (adjusted RR, 1.24 [95% CI, .71-2.19]) or incident infection (adjusted HR, 0.94 [95% CI, .52-1.69]). CONCLUSIONS: Serum anti-chlamydial IgG is not associated with a lowered rate of ascending or repeat infection. Identification of factors associated with ascending infection and increased risk of incident infection provide guidance for targeted screening of women at increased risk for sequelae."
1,"Chlamydia infection, PID, and infertility: further evidence from a case-control study in China",10.1186/s12905-022-01874-z,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis infection and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are well-known risk factors for female infertility. But there is limited evidence from China. This study aimed to further explore the associations between previous/current chlamydial infection, PID, and infertility in China. METHODS: We performed a 1:2 matched case-control study with two control groups: pregnant controls and non-pregnant controls in China in 2019. Women diagnosed with infertility were selected as cases (n = 255). Controls were selected based on the following criteria: Pregnant women who were documented in the selected hospitals were chosen as Pregnant controls (n = 510), and people who sought health care in Obstetric/Gynecologic clinics, Family Planning clinics, Dermatology and STD Department or Urological department were selected as Non-pregnant controls (n = 510). Infertility induced by male factors and people who used antibiotics in the vagina within two weeks were excluded. The first-stream specimen of urine samples was tested for chlamydia by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association. RESULTS: The prevalence of previous chlamydial infection and PID were significantly higher in cases (2.4%, 17.3%) than in controls (Non-pregnancy: 0.4%, 3.0%; Pregnancy: 0.4%, 9.0%). The current chlamydial infection rates were 5.9%, 7.3%, and 7.1% in infertile, pregnant, and non-pregnant women, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, PID largely elevated the risk of infertility (using non-pregnant controls: adjusted OR = 2.57, 95% CI 1.51, 4.39; using pregnant controls: adjusted OR = 6.83, 95% CI 3.47, 13.43). And the positive association between PID and tubal infertility was more obvious for both groups. For current chlamydial infection, none of the odds ratios were significant at the 0.05 level, while small sample size limited the evaluation of an association between prior chlamydial infection with infertility. CONCLUSIONS: Previous PID was indicated to largely increase the risk of infertility, especially tubal infertility. And there should be continuing emphasis on highly sensitive and specific biomarker for prior chlamydial infection."
0,Population-Based Study of Prediagnostic Antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis in Relation to Adverse Pregnancy Outcome,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000432,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted reported bacterial infections worldwide. The well-known sequelae of chlamydial infection include pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal factor infertility, but the evidence linking C. trachomatis infection and adverse pregnancy outcome is inconsistent and has been largely based on case-control studies with limited study populations. We evaluated this link in a population-based longitudinal biobank health registry setting. METHODS: The association between C. trachomatis major outer membrane protein (MOMP) peptide-specific IgG antibodies and ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, and preterm delivery was examined in a prospective case-control study nested in the Finnish Maternity Cohort. Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage cases were identified through the Hospital Discharge Register 1998-2005; cases with preterm deliveries were identified through the Finnish Medical Birth register 1988-2005. Control samples were retrieved from the Finnish Maternity Cohort serum bank. A total of 800 cases of ectopic pregnancy, 800 cases of miscarriage, and 1350 cases of preterm birth were included. Equal number of pregnant women without the outcome diagnosis served as controls. The cases and controls were matched by sampling time, at the serum sampling and postal code district. RESULTS: Antichlamydial IgG antibodies were associated with ectopic pregnancy. Positive antibody levels were found in 21.0% of cases and 14.6% of controls (P = 0.001; odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-2.03). Previous exposure to C. trachomatis, as indicated by serum antibodies, doubled the risk of ectopic pregnancy within age and was highest among women 35 years or older. Antichlamydial IgG antibody rates between the cases with miscarriage (16.3% in cases vs. 16.8% in controls) or preterm delivery (18.1% vs. 18.1%) and controls did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the association between previous exposure to C. trachomatis and ectopic pregnancy. We found no association between C. trachomatis seropositivity and miscarriage or preterm birth."

Between 70 and 90% of women are asymptomatic, however, untreated and persistent infections can lead to the development of urethritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and ectopic pregnancy. AIMS: To determine C. trachomatis infection frequency in a group of women in Chile, using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) and to compare the usefulness of endocervical and urine samples for C. trachomatis detection. METHODS: 87 asymptomatic women aged 15-64 years were included. Every woman donated one endocervical sample and one urine sample. Detection and quantification of C. trachomatis was performed by qPCR. RESULTS: Of 87 endocervical samples, the frequency was 11.49% (n = 10). Of these samples, 5 cases were found in women < 35 years old. About urine samples, 16 samples were positive (18.39%). Ten women < 35 years old yielded positive urine samples. Only four women had both samples positive for C. trachomatis (4.6%). There was no statistically significant relationship between age and C. trachomatis infection. Cryptic plasmid quantification was found between 3.55 - 96.050 copies/μL for endocervical samples and 7.22-633.1 copies/μL for urine samples. CONCLUSION: Estimated frequency of C. trachomatis in Chilean women was higher than previous Chilean studies. Both types of samples are complementary for screening and diagnosis strategies using sensitive techniques, because silent infection can be present in either urinary or genital tract or in both in women."
0,Combination with antimicrobial peptide lyses improves loop-mediated isothermal amplification based method for Chlamydia trachomatis detection directly in urine sample,10.1186/s12879-016-1674-0,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular human pathogen and is the most common cause of sexually transmitted diseases affecting both men and women. The pathogen can cause prostatitis and epididymitis in men. In women, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and acute or chronic pelvic pain are frequent complications. More than half of C. trachomatis-positive patients have minimal or no symptoms, providing an ongoing reservoir for the infection. The lack of sensitive large-scale applicable point- of- care (POC) tests for C. trachomatis detection makes it difficult to diagnose chlamydia infection efficiently in resource-limited environments. METHODS: A rapid and sensitive assay based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification method (LAMP) was combined with antimicrobial peptide lysis, which is able to detect at least 7 C. trachomatis pathogens per reaction directly from urine samples. RESULTS: Our study comprising 91 first-void urine samples showed that specificity of the assay is 100 % and sensitivity 73 % when using antimicrobial peptide lysis mix. Additionally we demonstrate that our assay does not give any cross-reactivity with 30 pathogen's DNA potentially present in the urine samples. Furthermore, the assay's novel approach does not require purification or extraction of DNA from clinical sample prior to amplification, so the need for specialized equipment is eliminated. CONCLUSIONS: The whole procedure is significantly less laborious, less time-consuming and consequently less expensive for early detection and identification of infectious disease. C. trachomatis specific LAMP assay is relatively simple to perform and could therefore be applied in numerous POC settings."
0,Diagnosing Chlamydia Trachomatis Urinary Tract Infections--Preliminary Report,10.17219/acem/43719,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis is mentioned among the etiologic factors for urinary tract infections. Chlamydias are parasites inside a cell. A very significant problem of C. trachomatis infections is their asymptomatic character. The most frequent infections caused by these bacteria are inflammations of the urethra and bladder; of the vagina, cervix, vaginal cavity and adnexa in women; and of the epididymis, testicles and prostate in men. In the diagnosis of C. trachomatis infections, the following methods are used: immunofluorescent techniques, immunoenzymatic assays, serological examinations and genetic techniques (for example PCR). OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to detect C. trachomatis among patients with symptoms of non-gonorrheal urethritis using diagnostic serologic methods and direct immunofluorescence. The purpose was to assess the connection between the incidence of urinary tract infections caused by C. trachomatis and symptoms that patients report as well as other data from interviews. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood serum and urethral smears were taken from each of 57 patients. The ELISA method was used to mark specific IgG and IgGcHSP60 anti-chlamydia antibodies in the blood serum. In the urethral smear, antigens were marked using the direct immunofluorescence method. RESULTS: Evidence for urinary tract infection caused by C. trachomatis was found in 15.79% of the examined patients using the immunofluorescence method. In the blood serum, positive results for IgGcHSP60 were obtained in 17.54% of the patients and for IgG in 8.77%. CONCLUSIONS: The studies carried out so far suggest that C. trachomatis has a significant role in the etiology of urethritis in adults and children. Other serological tests should be conducted in all the patients in order to study the immune responses in infected individuals and to confirm C. trachomatis infection using genetic methods such as PCR."
0,[Factors associated with Chlamydia trachomatis in women with vaginitis attending in primary health care],10.4067/S0716-10182021000300333,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis is recognized as the causative agent of one of the most common and curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In women, it can be a trigger for pelvic inflammatory disease, a risk factor for infertility or acquisition of other STIs. AIM: To determine CT in women with vaginitis and associate it with sociodemographic, sexual, clinical, and vaginal microbiota factors. METHODS: 121 female volunteers > 18 years of age, with a clinical diagnosis of vaginitis and abnormal vaginal discharge, attending in primary health care services (PHC) in Temuco-Chile were recluted. A vaginal discharge sample was taken, determining C. trachomatis by polymerase chain reaction and vaginal microbiota by Gram stain. Clinical, sociodemographic and sexual data were collected by survey. RESULTS: Age range was 18-61 years. The frequency of C. trachomatis was 14.9%. C. trachomatis was associated with a higher number of sexual partners in the last 5 years (p = 0.001), oral plus anal sex (p = 0.055) and sex toys (p = 0.027); there was a non-significant association with bacterial vaginosis 31.2% (p = 0.091) and initiation of sexual activity < 18 years 20.6% (p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: It would be beneficial to incorporate in the gynecological semiology of the women attended in PHC services, the factors found to favor C. trachomatis infection, as this could help the management of this STI."
1,"Frequency and genotypes of Chlamydia trachomatis in patients attending the obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Jalisco, Mexico and correlation with sociodemographic, behavioral, and biological factors",10.1186/s12905-017-0428-5,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis is the causative agent of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and genotypes of C. trachomatis in patients attending an obstetrics and gynecology clinic in Jalisco, Mexico and correlates them with sociodemographic, behavioral, and biological factors. METHODS: C. trachomatis detection was performed in endocervical samples from 662 patients by direct fluorescence assay (DFA) and two PCR assays that amplified the phospholipase D endonuclease superfamily protein (PLDESP) and OmpA genes. Positive samples were genotyped using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. Sociodemographic, behavioral, and biological data were collected. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 31 (range, 14-78) years. C. trachomatis positivity was detected by DFA in 16.7% (n = 111), PLDESP gene amplification in 14.2% (n = 94), and OmpA gene amplification in 14.5% (n = 96) of the population. Eight C. trachomatis genotypes were detected: E (39.6%), F (29.2%), D (15.6%), K (6.3%), L2 (3.1%), G, J, and I (2.1% each). C. trachomatis infection was associated with age, marital status, pregnancy, and hormonal contraceptive use (all p = 0.01); intrauterine device use and previous premature birth (both p = 0.03); and infection during pregnancy, previous ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and green vaginal discharge (all p = 0.04). C. trachomatis genotype K was more likely to be detected in women histories of ≥2 sexual partners, genotype F was more likely in pregnant women, genotype L2 was more likely in women with PID, genotype D was more likely in women who had had infection during previous pregnancies, and genotype E was more likely in those with previous ectopic pregnancies and green vaginal discharge (all p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of C. trachomatis in our population was higher than previously reported worldwide, but within the range reported for Mexico. Genotype E was detected most frequently in the study population. Infection by C. trachomatis and C. trachomatis genotypes K, F, D, and E was strongly associated with multiple sociodemographic, behavioral, and biological factors. C. trachomatis genotype L2 was detected in women with PID."
0,[Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence in women from the Hospital General de Zona No. 29],,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis is the main cause of sexually transmitted bacterial infections worldwide. An estimated of 131 million cases occur each year. It is asymptomatic, but ascending infection in women can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of C. trachomatis in open population women who attend the Hospital General de Zona No. 29. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Identification of C. trachomatis was carried out by PCR testing of 200 vaginal exudate samples and its genotype was determined. In parallel, a routine microbiological diagnosis was carried out. RESULTS: The prevalence of C. trachomatis was 8.5% (17/200) with a significant concomitance of p = 0.006 with Gardnerella vaginalis (relative risk of 2.871, 95%CI: 1.574-5.236). Likewise, C. trachomatis was identified in 5 samples as the only etiological agent. Sixteen strains of C. trachomatis belong to genotype F. An identified strain of C. trachomatis presented genetic motifs similar to the Mexican variant reported in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of C. trachomatis in the studied population indicates the need to implement diagnostic techniques for this bacterium. The use of PCR allows a rapid genotypic determination that would explain the epidemiological behavior of C. trachomatis and would represent a significant improvement in the quality of life of the patient."
0,Seroprevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis Among Female Adults in the United States: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys,10.1093/cid/ciaa1879,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common nationally notifiable sexually transmitted infection in the United States; however, the seroprevalence of C. trachomatis infection is unknown. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1725 females aged 18 to 39 years who provided serum and urine samples in the 2013 through 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Presence of anti-C. trachomatis Pgp3 immunoglobulin G (IgG) was determined using both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiplex bead array (MBA). Weighted seroprevalence estimates were calculated. Correlates of seroprevalence were examined by multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: In 2013 through 2016, overall seroprevalence of C. trachomatis Pgp3 IgG was 30.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.5-35.0) as measured by ELISA and 29.4% (95% CI, 25.8-33.0) as measured by the MBA assay. Overall agreement between tests was 87.1% (1503/1725). There was a high positive agreement by the MBA assay with current detection of chlamydia in urine (86% [36/42]), a past-year diagnosis of chlamydia (81.8% [27/33]), and a history of treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease (60.7% [37/61]). Seroprevalence of C. trachomatis Pgp3 IgG, as measured by MBA, was significantly higher among non-Hispanic Blacks (68.0%; adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 2.7 [95% CI, 2.3-3.3]), Mexican Americans (30.9%; aPR = 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.9]), and other Hispanics (35.0%; aPR = 1.9 [95% CI, 1.4-2.5]) compared with non-Hispanic Whites (21.4%). A higher lifetime number of sexual partners and a younger age at sexual debut was also associated with higher seroprevalence. CONCLUSION: Both the ELISA and MBA serologic assays revealed a high prevalence of antibodies to C. trachomatis Pgp3 in young adult females in the US household population. There were major racial/ethnic disparities in exposure to C. trachomatis, with increased vulnerability among non-Hispanic Black females."
0,"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in the Lifetime Risk of Chlamydia trachomatis Diagnosis and Adverse Reproductive Health Outcomes Among Women in King County, Washington",10.1093/cid/ciy099,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common reportable infection in the United States and can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and tubal factor infertility (TFI). METHODS: We created life tables to estimate the ""lifetime"" risk of chlamydia diagnosis among women aged 15-34 years in King County, Washington, between 1992 and 2014. We estimated the lifetime risk of chlamydia-associated PID and TFI incorporating published estimates of the risk of sequelae. RESULTS: There were 51464 first chlamydia diagnoses in 1992-2014. For women born between 1980 and 1984, the lifetime risk of chlamydia diagnosis was 19.8% overall and 14.0% for non-Hispanic white, 64.9% for non-Hispanic black, and 32.6% for Hispanic women. The cumulative risk of chlamydia by age 24 increased overall from 13.9% to 17.3% among women born between 1975 and 1994 but declined among non-Hispanic black women, among whom risk by age 24 declined from 57.3% among women born between 1980 and 1984 to 38.6% among women born between 1990 and 1994. The lifetime risk of chlamydia-associated PID among women born between 1980 and 1984 ranged from 0.33% to 1.14%. Among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic women, the lifetime risk of chlamydia-associated TFI was 0.04%, 0.20%, and 0.10%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Over 60% of non-Hispanic black women had at least 1 chlamydia diagnosis by age 34 in the birth cohorts most affected, a risk almost 5 times that in non-Hispanic whites. An estimated 1 in 500 non-Hispanic black women develops chlamydia-associated TFI. More effective control measures are needed."
0,"The Burden of Human Papillomavirus and Chlamydia trachomatis Coinfection in Women: A Large Cohort Study in Inner Mongolia, China",10.1093/infdis/jiy497,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis may coinfect with human papillomavirus (HPV) and complicate the cervical pathogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of HPV/C. trachomatis coinfection in women from Inner Mongolia, China. METHODS: We performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based HPV/C. trachomatis screening and cervical samples were analyzed by thinprep cytologic test. Statistical analysis was used to assess the association between demographic factors and coinfection. RESULTS: Among the 2345 women recruited, the prevalences of HPV, C. trachomatis, and HPV/C. trachomatis coinfection were 36.0%, 14.3%, and 4.8%, respectively. The rate of multiple HPV genotypes was higher in coinfected women. HPV66 was the most frequently identified genotype in coinfected participants. The HPV DNA load was significantly higher in HPV monoinfected cases. In contrast, the DNA load of C. trachomatis was significantly higher in the coinfection group. Risk factors, including single women (odds ratio [OR] = 6.0, 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.044-8.782) and women with multiple sex partners (OR = 1.9, 95% CI, 1.324-2.824), were associated with coinfection. Importantly, coinfection was associated with increased risk for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. CONCLUSIONS: HPV and C. trachomatis coinfection is an important risk factor for the progression of cervical lesions."
0,"The Impact of Prescriptions on Sex Partner Treatment Using Expedited Partner Therapy for Chlamydia trachomatis Infection, New York City, 2014-2015",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000511,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis reinfections, often resulting from resuming sex with untreated partners, can increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Expedited partner therapy (EPT) has been shown to prevent reinfection when provided as medication (Medication-EPT) that patients give to sex partners; however, EPT is often provided as a prescription (Prescription-EPT). We compared partner treatment outcomes for Medication-EPT versus Prescription-EPT. METHODS: We conducted telephone interviews from October 2014 to October 2015 with a population-based random sample of women aged 15 to 25 years diagnosed with Chlamydia trachomatis. Interview questions included: demographics, patient-treatment, EPT type, and patient report of partner treatment. The main outcomes explored were: proportion of women receiving EPT, proportion of Prescription-EPT and Medication-EPT, and proportion of partners reported as treated. We used χ and Fisher exact tests for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 421 women completed the interview; 357 (84.8%) of 421 women reported having been treated, and 109/357 (30.5%) received EPT for any partner. Women given a prescription (vs medication) for their own treatment were more likely to receive EPT (odds ratio, 1.57; P = 0.05) and to receive Prescription-EPT specifically (odds ratio, 6.85; P < 0.0001). Forty-eight (52.2%) of 92 patients who received EPT for their most recent partner received Prescription-EPT. There was no difference by EPT type in proportion of index patients reporting partner treatment: 77.1% (37/48) for Prescription-EPT versus 79.5% (35/44) for Medication-EPT (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Prescription-EPT and Medication-EPT appear to result in comparable rates of partner treatment. Further research is needed to assess the effects of Prescription-EPT on partner treatment among adolescents and in other contexts."
0,Lymphogranuloma Venereum-Associated Proctitis Mimicking a Malignant Rectal Neoplasia: Searching for Diagnosis,10.1159/000516011,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis-lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and an uncommon cause of proctitis. The diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion, since the clinical, imaging, endoscopic, and histological findings can mimic multiple benign or malignant conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and rectal neoplasms. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 48-year-old Caucasian male with no significant previous medical history who was admitted due to the suspicion of a rectal neoplasia. He underwent an abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before admission due to complaints of anorectal pain, hematochezia, and constipation over the previous 2 weeks. The examination revealed a circumferential rectal wall thickening, infiltration of the perirectal fat and invasion of the mesorectal fascia, associated with perirectal fat lymphadenopathy. A radiological diagnosis of a rectal malignant neoplasia staged as T4N2MX was stated. Digital rectal examination identified a circumferential rectal tumor. Rectosigmoidoscopy showed an extensive and circumferential ulceration of the rectal mucosa, with elevated geographical borders, exudate, and aphthoid erosions at the proximal limit of the endoscopic mucosal ulceration. Biopsy specimens revealed acute ulcerative proctitis with lymphoplasmocytic inflammatory infiltrate but no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. A STI screening was positive for HIV-1 (CD4+ 251/mm3; N = 700-1,100) and C. trachomatis, with an elevated IgA-specific antibody titer (52.000; N < 5.0), suggesting LGV disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by the identification of C. trachomatis DNA on rectal swab. Other infectious causes of acute proctitis were excluded. When faced with these results, the patient ended up mentioning that he had unprotected anal sex with men. He started treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 21 days, with a drastic improvement. Rectosigmoidoscopy was repeated and showed clear signs of progressive resolution of the ulcerative proctitis. DISCUSSION: LGV-associated proctitis, often undervalued, is a reemerging disease which should always be considered a benign cause of rectal mass, in order to avoid delay in diagnosis and development of complications. Diagnosis becomes more challenging in patients with unknown HIV status. A detailed clinical history, including sexual behaviors, is a vital step to achieve the final diagnosis."
0,Bowel obstruction due to Chlamydia trachomatis: a case report and review of literature,10.1186/s40792-021-01130-w,"BACKGROUND: Chlamydial infection is a difficult-to-diagnose type of sexually transmitted disease that occurs mainly in young people. We report a case of bowel obstruction caused by intrapelvic adhesions formed by chlamydial infection. CASE PRESENTATION: This patient was a 23-year-old woman who had been suffering from acute abdominal pain. She had been previously treated several times for intrapelvic abscesses and had a history of chlamydial infection. Endometriosis was thought to be the cause of her pelvic abscess based on endoscopic findings. Computed tomography demonstrated a small bowel obstruction caused by a pelvic abscess. However, the diagnosis could not be confirmed. She underwent laparoscopic surgery and was diagnosed with bowel obstruction due to adhesion of chlamydial infection based on the intraoperative findings and Chlamydia trachomatis antibody test. She was discharged 5 days after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to consider the possibility of chlamydial infection as a cause for lower abdominal pain and unexplained bowel obstruction in female patients."
0,First Detection of Chlamydia trachomatis 'Swedish' Variant (nvCT) in a Russian Couple with Infertility,10.2174/1874285801812010343,"BACKGROUND: Chronic asymptomatic chlamydial genital infection caused by the wild-type of Chlamydia trachomatis (wtCT) is the most common bacterial infection causing human infertility. The novel 'Swedish' variant of С.trachomatis (nvCT) which contains a 377 bp deletion in a region that is specifically targeted in some nucleic acid amplification tests may impede diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate whether nvCT may be a possible cause of infertility in a couple undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). METHOD: Clinical specimens from both genital (urethra and cervix) and extra-genital sites (pharynx, conjunctive, blood) of a couple who experienced multiple unsuccessful attempts at pregnancy by natural fertilization and IVF procedures were analyzed before and after antibiotic therapy. Both partners had neither somatic nor endocrinal abnormality nor any clinically apparent genital manifestations of Chlamydia or other STIs. RESULTS: Before antibiotic therapy all the samples of the Female Partner (FP) contained DNA of only the nvCT. After antibiotic therapy, additionally, DNA of wtCT of genovars E and D was detected in specimens from her conjunctiva and oropharynx. All samples of the Male Partner (MP) revealed co-infection of nvCT and wtCT. Identical SNP within the variable region 4 (VD4) of the ompA gene confirmed the identity of the wtCT strains found in both partners. The FP had a positive anti-chlamydial IgG titer. The sperm characteristics of the MP, motility (immotile spermatozoa was 51.1% versus 21.6%) and vitality (46% versus 68%) declined progressively, and the MP anti-chlamydial IgG titer was negative. CONCLUSION: Infertility in this couple may have been caused by chronic asymptomatic and persistent nvCT-associated infection that was complicated by re-infection later with wtCT. This study illustrates the importance of including detection methods for nvCT strains in the investigation of infertility cases."
0,"The diagnosis of chronic endometritis in infertile asymptomatic women: a comparative study of histology, microbial cultures, hysteroscopy, and molecular microbiology",10.1016/j.ajog.2018.02.012,"BACKGROUND: Chronic endometritis is a persistent inflammation of the endometrial mucosa caused by bacterial pathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Mycoplasma, and Ureaplasma. Although chronic endometritis can be asymptomatic, it is found in up to 40% of infertile patients and is responsible for repeated implantation failure and recurrent miscarriage. Diagnosis of chronic endometritis is based on hysteroscopy of the uterine cavity, endometrial biopsy with plasma cells being identified histologically, while specific treatment is determined based on microbial culture. However, not all microorganisms implicated are easily or readily culturable needing a turnaround time of up to 1 week. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a molecular diagnostic tool for chronic endometritis based on real-time polymerase chain reaction equivalent to using the 3 classic methods together, overcoming the bias of using any of them alone. STUDY DESIGN: Endometrial samples from patients assessed for chronic endometritis (n = 113) using at least 1 or several conventional diagnostic methods namely histology, hysteroscopy, and/or microbial culture, were blindly evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction for the presence of 9 chronic endometritis pathogens: Chlamydia trachomatis, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. The sensitivity and specificity of the molecular analysis vs the classic diagnostic techniques were compared in the 65 patients assessed by all 3 recognized classic methods. RESULTS: The molecular method showed concordant results with histological diagnosis in 30 samples (14 double positive and 16 double negative) with a matching accuracy of 46.15%. Concordance of molecular and hysteroscopic diagnosis was observed in 38 samples (37 double positive and 1 double negative), with an accuracy of 58.46%. When the molecular method was compared to microbial culture, concordance was present in 37 samples (22 double positive and 15 double negative), a matching rate of 56.92%. When cases of potential contamination and/or noncultivable bacteria were considered, the accuracy increased to 66.15%. Of these 65 patients, only 27 patients had consistent histological + hysteroscopic diagnosis, revealing 58.64% of nonconcordant results. Only 13 of 65 patients (20%) had consistent histology + hysteroscopy + microbial culture results. In these cases, the molecular microbiology matched in 10 cases showing a diagnostic accuracy of 76.92%. Interestingly, the molecular microbiology confirmed over half of the isolated pathogens and provided additional detection of nonculturable microorganisms. These results were confirmed by the microbiome assessed by next-generation sequencing. In the endometrial samples with concordant histology + hysteroscopy + microbial culture results, the molecular microbiology diagnosis demonstrates 75% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive and 25% negative predictive values, and 0% false-positive and 25% false-negative rates. CONCLUSION: The molecular microbiology method describe herein is a fast and inexpensive diagnostic tool that allows for the identification of culturable and nonculturable endometrial pathogens associated with chronic endometritis. The results obtained were similar to all 3 classic diagnostic methods together with a degree of concordance of 76.92% providing an opportunity to improve the clinical management of infertile patients with a risk of experiencing this ghost endometrial pathology."
0,Improvement in Neisseria gonorrhoeae culture rates by bedside inoculation and incubation at a clinic for sexually transmitted infections.,10.1186/s12941-023-00576-0,"BACKGROUND: Culture of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is essential for surveillance of complete antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. In 2014, the culture success rate  of N. gonorrhoeae from samples taken at the clinic for sexually transmitted  infections (STI clinic), Oslo University Hospital, Norway, was only 20%. The  present study aimed to improve gonococcal culture rates using bedside inoculation  of patient samples on gonococcal agar plates and incubation at the STI clinic.  METHODS: This prospective quality improvement study was conducted by the STI  clinic and the Department of Microbiology at Oslo University Hospital from May  2016 - October 2017. When culture of N. gonorrhoeae was clinically indicated, we  introduced a parallel 'bedside culture' at the STI clinic and compared results  with the standard culture at the microbiology department. Samples were taken from  urethra, anorectum, pharynx and cervix. Culture rates were compared across  symptomatic and asymptomatic anatomical sites. RESULTS: From 596  gonococcal-positive PCR samples, bedside culture had a significantly higher  success rate of 57% compared to 41% with standard culture (p < 0.05). Overall,  culture rate from symptomatic sites was 91% v. 45% from asymptomatic sites. The  culture rates from different anatomical sites were as follows: urethra 93%,  anorectum 64%, pharynx 28% and cervix 70%. Bedside culture significantly  (p < 0.05) improved the culture rates for symptomatic urethral and asymptomatic  pharyngeal samples. CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, bedside inoculation on  gonococcal agar plates and incubation of samples from patients with gonorrhoea is  recommended. This will improve the culture diagnostics and provide additional  gonococcal isolates for antimicrobial resistance surveillance."
1,Chlamydia sequelae cost estimates used in current economic evaluations: does one-size-fit-all?,10.1136/sextrans-2016-052597,"BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that chlamydia screening programmes can be cost-effective, conditional on assumptions within mathematical models. We explored differences in cost estimates used in published economic evaluations of chlamydia screening from seven countries (four papers each from UK and the Netherlands, two each from Sweden and Australia, and one each from Ireland, Canada and Denmark). METHODS: From these studies, we extracted management cost estimates for seven major chlamydia sequelae. In order to compare the influence of different sequelae considered in each paper and their corresponding management costs on the total cost per case of untreated chlamydia, we applied reported unit sequelae management costs considered in each paper to a set of untreated infection to sequela progression probabilities. All costs were adjusted to 2013/2014 Great British Pound (GBP) values. RESULTS: Sequelae management costs ranged from £171 to £3635 (pelvic inflammatory disease); £953 to £3615 (ectopic pregnancy); £546 to £6752 (tubal factor infertility); £159 to £3341 (chronic pelvic pain); £22 to £1008 (epididymitis); £11 to £1459 (neonatal conjunctivitis) and £433 to £3992 (neonatal pneumonia). Total cost of sequelae per case of untreated chlamydia ranged from £37 to £412. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial variation in cost per case of chlamydia sequelae used in published chlamydia screening economic evaluations, which likely arose from different assumptions about disease management pathways and the country perspectives taken. In light of this, when interpreting these studies, the reader should be satisfied that the cost estimates used sufficiently reflect the perspective taken and current disease management for their respective context."
0,"Detection of anorectal and cervicovaginal Chlamydia trachomatis infections following azithromycin treatment: prospective cohort study with multiple time-sequential measures of rRNA, DNA, quantitative load and symptoms",10.1371/journal.pone.0081236,"BACKGROUND: Determination of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) treatment success is hampered by current assessment methods, which involve a single post-treatment measurement only. Therefore, we evaluated Ct detection by applying multiple laboratory measures on time-sequential post-treatment samples. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was established with azithromycin-treated (1000 mg) Ct patients (44 cervicovaginal and 15 anorectal cases). Each patient provided 18 self-taken samples pre-treatment and for 8 weeks post-treatment (response: 96%; 1,016 samples). Samples were tested for 16S rRNA (TMA), bacterial load (quantitative PCR; Chlamydia plasmid DNA) and type (serovar and multilocus sequence typing). Covariates (including behavior, pre-treatment load, anatomic site, symptoms, age, and menstruation) were tested for their potential association with positivity and load at 3-8 weeks using regression analyses controlling for repeated measures. FINDINGS: By day 9, Ct positivity decreased to 20% and the median load to 0.3 inclusion-forming units (IFU) per ml (pre-treatment: 170 IFU/ml). Of the 35 cases who reported no sex, sex with a treated partner or safe sex with a new partner, 40% had detection, i.e. one or more positive samples from 3-8 weeks (same Ct type over time), indicating possible antimicrobial treatment failure. Cases showed intermittent positive detection and the number of positive samples was higher in anorectal cases than in cervicovaginal cases. The highest observed bacterial load between 3-8 weeks post-treatment was 313 IFU/ml, yet the majority (65%) of positive samples showed a load of ≤ 2 IFU/ml. Pre-treatment load was found to be associated with later load in anorectal cases. CONCLUSIONS: A single test at 3-8 weeks post-treatment frequently misses Ct. Detection reveals intermittent low loads, with an unknown risk of later complications or transmission. These findings warrant critical re-evaluation of the clinical management of single dose azithromycin-treated Ct patients and fuel the debate on defining treatment failure.

1,Prevalence of 7 sexually transmitted organisms by multiplex real-time PCR in Fallopian tube specimens collected from Saudi women with and without ectopic pregnancy,10.1186/s12879-015-1313-1,"BACKGROUND: Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is associated with maternal morbidity and occasionally mortality during the first trimester. A history of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and pelvic inflammatory disease have been implicated as major risk factors for EP. Our aim was to measure the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Ureaplasma parvum/urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis and herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1&2 in Fallopian tubes collected from EP and the results were compared with those obtained from total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and tubal ligation. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study and tubal samples were collected from 135 Saudi women recruited from 3 centres in the Western region as follow: 84 EPs, 20 TAH and 31 tubal ligations. Multiplex TaqMan PCR was performed using an IVD CE kit for the simultaneous detection of candidate pathogens following DNA extraction. RESULTS: Infections were detected in 31.8 % of the 135 participants either as single (11.1 %) or co-infections (20.7 %) and the frequencies were significantly higher in EP (42.85 %) compared with control (13.72 %). The rates of CT (27.4 %; P = 0.001); MG (20.2 %; P = 0.009) and HSV-1/2 (21.4 %; P = 0.01) were significantly higher in EP. No significant difference between the study groups was observed for the other pathogens (P > 0.05). Binary logistic regression also showed that infection with ≥ 2 pathogens (OR 4.9; 95 % CI: 2.2 - 11.6; P = 0.006), CT (OR 3.07; 95 % CI: 1.3 - 12.3; P = 0.002), MG (OR 2.3; 95 % CI: 1.1 - 8.6; P = 0.03) and HSV-1/2 (OR 1.7; 95 % CI: 0.75 - 5.7; P = 0.004) were associated with a significantly higher risk of developing EP. CONCLUSIONS: STIs are frequent in the upper genital tract of Saudi women during the reproductive age and, CT, MG and HSV-1/2 were more prevalent in EP. The observed high rates of co-infection advocate the necessity of establishing national guidelines and/or screening program utilising multiplex PCR approach for the detection of common STIs among high risk groups in the kingdom. Further studies are needed to measure the adverse reproductive outcomes associated with STIs in Saudi Arabia."
0,Azithromycin-liposomes as a novel approach for localized therapy of cervicovaginal bacterial infections,10.2147/IJN.S211691,"BACKGROUND: Efficient localized cervicovaginal antibacterial therapy, enabling the delivery of antibiotic to the site of action at lower doses while escaping systemic drug effects and reducing the risk of developing microbial resistance, is attracting considerable attention. Liposomes have been shown to allow sustained drug release into vaginal mucosa and improve delivery of antibiotics to bacterial cells and biofilms. Azithromycin (AZI), a potent broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic, has not yet been investigated for localized therapy of cervicovaginal infections, although it is administered orally for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Encapsulation of AZI in liposomes could improve its solubility, antibacterial activity, and allow the prolonged drug release in the cervicovaginal tissue, while avoiding systemic side effects. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to develop AZI-liposomes and explore their potentials for treating cervicovaginal infections. METHODS: AZI-liposomes that differed in bilayer elasticity/rigidity and surface charge were prepared and evaluated under simulated cervicovaginal conditions to yield optimized liposomes, which were assessed for antibacterial activity against several planktonic and biofilm-forming Escherichia coli strains and intracellular Chlamydia trachomatis, ex vivo AZI vaginal deposition/penetration, and in vitro cytotoxicity toward cervical cells. RESULTS: Negatively charged liposomes with rigid bilayers (CL-3), propylene glycol liposomes (PGL-2) and deformable propylene glycol liposomes (DPGL-2) were efficient against planktonic E. coli ATCC 700928 and K-12. CL-3 was superior for preventing the formation of E. coli ATCC 700928 and K-12 biofilms, with IC50 values (concentrations that inhibit biofilm viability by 50%) up to 8-fold lower than those of the control (free AZI). DPGL-2 was the most promising for eradication of already formed E. coli biofilms and for treating C. trachomatis infections. All AZI-liposomes were biocompatible with cervical cells and improved localization of the drug inside vaginal tissue compared with the control. CONCLUSION: The performed studies confirm the potentials of AZI-liposomes for localized cervicovaginal therapy."
0,Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in a clinical presentation of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome: a case report with multigene diagnostic approach,10.1186/1472-6874-14-95,"BACKGROUND: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS) is caused by inflammation of perihepatic capsules associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. In recent years, infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have been increasingly occurring in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. However, NTM has never been reported in patients with FHCS. We present the first case of a patient with extrapulmonary NTM infection in a clinical presentation of FHCS. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old Korean woman presented with right upper quadrant and suprapubic pain. She was initially suspected to have FHCS. However, she was refractory to conventional antibiotic therapy. Laparoscopy revealed multiple violin-string adhesions of the parietal peritoneum to the liver and miliary-like nodules on the peritoneal surfaces. Diagnosis of NTM was confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction analysis results of biopsy specimens that showed caseating granulomas with positive acid-fast bacilli. Treatment with anti-NTM medications was initiated, and the patient's symptoms were considerably ameliorated. CONCLUSIONS: An awareness of NTM as potential pathogens, even in previously healthy adults, and efforts to exclude other confounding diseases are important to establish the diagnosis of NTM disease. NTM infection can cause various clinical manifestations, which in the present case, overlapped with the symptoms of perihepatic inflammation seen in FHCS."
0,Acute Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome in a man due to gonococcal infection,10.1016/j.jemermed.2014.04.043,"BACKGROUND: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a rare extra-pelvic complication of genital infection involving the perihepatic capsule. Most cases have been described in women in association with pelvic inflammatory disease; in rare cases it has been reported in men. Because the main symptom is acute abdominal pain, and laboratory and imaging findings are frequently nonspecific, the differential diagnosis, considering other gastrointestinal or renal diseases, can be difficult in the early stage of the syndrome, leading to frequent misdiagnosis and mismanagement. CASE REPORT: We report a case of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome in a 26-year-old man who first presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. Diagnosis was possible on the basis of clinical signs of orchiepididymitis, abnormal ultrasound findings, and specialist consultation with the Sexually Transmitted Infection Clinic. An acute gonoccocal infection was revealed, which was complicated by a collection of free perihepatic fluid and a subcapsular hypoechoic focal lesion. Prompt antibiotic therapy was established, with complete resolution of the symptoms within a few days. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Awareness of the clinical presentation, imaging, and laboratory findings during the acute phase of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome could help emergency physicians to make an early diagnosis and to correctly manage such patients. Improved diagnostic skills could prevent chronic complications that are especially a risk in the case of delayed or minor genitourinary symptoms."
0,Chlamydia trachomatis-induced Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome: a case report,10.1186/s13104-016-2357-z,"BACKGROUND: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is defined as perihepatitis associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. Chlamydia trachomatis is one of its most common aetiologies. This syndrome usually presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain mimicking other hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal pathologies, hence, posing a diagnostic dilemma in settings with limited diagnostic tools. CASE REPORT: A 32 year old African female presented with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain and vaginal discharge, for which she had previously received treatment in another health center with no improvement. Clinical and laboratory findings were suggestive of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. Five days after treatment with oral doxycycline, the patient showed marked clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a common cause of right upper quadrant pain which is often under diagnosed in poor communities. Hence, it should be included as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain, especially in females of reproductive age."
0,Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome associated with tuberculous salpingitis and peritonitis: a case presentation and review of literature,10.1186/s12876-018-0768-0,"BACKGROUND: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome or acute perihepatitis is considered a rare complication of pelvic inflammatory disease, mostly associated with chlamydial or gonococcal salpingitis. Peritoneal tuberculosis is a rare site of extra-pulmonary infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Infection usually occurs after reactivation of latent tuberculous foci in the peritoneum and more seldom after contiguous spread from tuberculous salpingitis. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a 21-year old female of Somalian origin diagnosed with Fitz-Hugh Curtis syndrome associated with tuberculous salpingitis and peritonitis, presenting with new onset ascites. Acid fast stained smear and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis on ascitic fluid, endocervical culture and tuberculin skin test were all negative. Eventually, the diagnosis was made laparoscopically, showing multiple peritoneal white nodules and perihepatic ""violin string"" fibrinous strands. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case where Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is associated with both peritoneal and genital tuberculosis and where ascites was the primary clinical finding. Female genital tuberculosis has only rarely been associated with Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome and all cases presented with chronic abdominal pain and/or infertility. Ascites and peritoneal involvement was not present in any case. Moreover, most patients with Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome show no evidence of generalized intra-abdominal infection and only occasionally have concomitant ascites."
0,Self-Reported Reproductive Tract Infections and Ultrasound Diagnosed Uterine Fibroids in African-American Women,10.1089/jwh.2014.5051,"BACKGROUND: For decades, it has been hypothesized that reproductive tract infections (RTIs) are risk factors for uterine fibroids. However, only two recent studies have been conducted. We aimed to investigate the relationship between RTIs and fibroids in a large study using ultrasound screening for fibroids. METHODS: We used cross-sectional enrollment data from African American women ages 23-34 years with no previous fibroid diagnosis. RTI history was measured by self-report and fibroid status by standardized ultrasound. Secondary fibroid outcomes were size, number, and total volume. Age- and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: In total, 1,656 women were included; 22% had fibroids. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was associated with a 21% increased odds of fibroids [aOR 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.58]. Chlamydia infection and pelvic inflammatory disease were associated with a 38% (aOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.97) and a 46% (aOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25-1.17) reduced odds of having two or more fibroids, respectively. Those with a previous BV diagnosis had a 47% increased odds of having 2 or more fibroids (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 0.98-2.21) and a 41% increased odds of having a larger total fibroid volume (aOR 1.41, 95% CI 0.98-2.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our study was the first to explore the relationship between RTIs and fibroid size, number, and total volume. There appeared to be no strong associations between self-reported RTIs and fibroids. Studies using serology, a biochemical measure of past infection, are needed to better investigate associations between RTIs and fibroids."
0,A unique insight into the MiRNA profile during genital chlamydial infection,10.1186/s12864-019-5495-6,"BACKGROUND: Genital C. trachomatis infection may cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) that can lead to tubal factor infertility (TFI). Understanding the pathogenesis of chlamydial complications including the pathophysiological processes within the female host genital tract is important in preventing adverse pathology. MicroRNAs regulate several pathophysiological processes of infectious and non-infectious etiologies. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the miRNA profile of single and repeat genital chlamydial infections will be different and that these differences will be time dependent. Thus, we analyzed and compared differentially expressed mice genital tract miRNAs after single and repeat chlamydia infections using a C. muridarum mouse model. Mice were sacrificed and their genital tract tissues were collected at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after a single and repeat chlamydia infections. Histopathology, and miRNA sequencing were performed. RESULTS: Histopathology presentation showed that the oviduct and uterus of reinfected mice were more inflamed, distended and dilated compared to mice infected once. The miRNAs expression profile was different in the reproductive tissues after a reinfection, with a greater number of miRNAs expressed after reinfection. Also, the number of miRNAs expressed each week after chlamydia infection and reinfection varied, with weeks eight and one having the highest number of differentially expressed miRNAs for chlamydia infection and reinfection respectively. Ten miRNAs; mmu-miR-378b, mmu-miR-204-5p, mmu-miR-151-5p, mmu-miR-142-3p, mmu-miR-128-3p, mmu-miR-335-3p, mmu-miR-195a-3p, mmu-miR-142-5p, mmu-miR-106a-5p and mmu-miR-92a-3p were common in both primary chlamydia infection and reinfection. Pathway analysis showed that, amongst other functions, the differentially regulated miRNAs control pathways involved in cellular and tissue development, disease conditions and toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the changes in miRNA expression over time after chlamydia infection and reinfection, as well as the pathways they regulate to determine pathological outcomes. The miRNAs networks generated in our study shows that there are differences in the focus molecules involved in significant biological functions in chlamydia infection and reinfection, implying that chlamydial pathogenesis occurs differently for each type of infection and that this could be important when determining treatments regime and disease outcome. The study underscores the crucial role of host factors in chlamydia pathogenesis."
1,Pregnancy and fertility-related adverse outcomes associated with Chlamydia trachomatis infection: a global systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1136/sextrans-2019-053999,"BACKGROUND: Genital chlamydia infection in women is often asymptomatic, but may result in adverse outcomes before and during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to examine the strength of the relationships between chlamydia infection and different reproductive health outcomes and to assess the certainty of the evidence. METHODS: This review was registered and followed the Cochrane guidelines. We searched three databases to quantitatively examine adverse outcomes associated with chlamydia infection. We included pregnancy and fertility-related outcomes. We performed meta-analyses on different study designs for various adverse outcomes using unadjusted and adjusted analyses. RESULTS: We identified 4730 unique citations and included 107 studies reporting 12 pregnancy and fertility-related outcomes. Sixty-eight studies were conducted in high-income countries, 37 studies were conducted in low-income or middle-income countries, and 2 studies were conducted in both high-income and low-income countries. Chlamydia infection was positively associated with almost all of the 12 included pregnancy and fertility-related adverse outcomes in unadjusted analyses, including stillbirth (OR=5.05, 95% CI 2.95 to 8.65 for case-control studies and risk ratio=1.28, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.51 for cohort studies) and spontaneous abortion (OR=1.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.49 for case-control studies and risk ratio=1.47, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.85 for cohort studies). However, there were biases in the design and conduct of individual studies, affecting the certainty of the overall body of evidence. The risk of adverse outcomes associated with chlamydia is higher in low-income and middle-income countries compared with high-income countries. CONCLUSION: Chlamydia is associated with an increased risk of several pregnancy and fertility-related adverse outcomes in unadjusted analyses, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Further research on how to prevent the sequelae of chlamydia in pregnant women is needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017056818."
1,Early screening for Chlamydia trachomatis in young women for primary prevention of pelvic inflammatory disease (i-Predict): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,10.1186/s13063-017-2211-1,"BACKGROUND: Genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection, especially among young women. Mostly asymptomatic, it can lead, if untreated, to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubal factor infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Recent data suggest that Ct infections are not controlled in France and in Europe. The effectiveness of a systematic strategy for Ct screening in under-25 women remains controversial. The main objective of the i-Predict trial (Prevention of Diseases Induced by Chlamydia trachomatis) is to determine whether early screening and treatment of 18- to-24-year-old women for genital Ct infection reduces the incidence of PID over 24 months. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomised prevention trial including 4000 eighteen- to twenty-four-year-old sexually active female students enrolled at five universities. The participants will provide a self-collected vaginal swab sample and fill in an electronic questionnaire at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months after recruitment. Vaginal swabs in the intervention arm will be analysed immediately for Ct positivity, and participants will be referred for treatment if they have a positive test result. Vaginal swabs from the control arm will be analysed at the end of the study. All visits to general practitioners, gynaecologists or gynaecology emergency departments for pelvic pain or other gynaecological symptoms will be recorded to evaluate the incidence of PID, and all participants will attend a final visit in a hospital gynaecology department. The primary endpoint measure will be the incidence of PID over 24 months. The outcome status (confirmed, probable or no PID) will be assessed by two independent experts blinded to group assignment and Ct status. DISCUSSION: This trial is expected to largely contribute to the development of recommendations for Ct screening in young women in France to prevent PID and related complications. It is part of a comprehensive approach to gathering data to facilitate decision-making regarding optimal strategies for Ct infection control. The control group of this randomised trial, following current recommendations, will allow better documentation of the natural history of Ct infection, a prerequisite to evaluating the impact of Ct screening. Characterisation of host immunogenetics will also allow identification of women at risk for complications. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02904811 . Registered on September 14, 2016.

0,Screening for genital chlamydia infection,10.1002/14651858.CD010866.pub2,"BACKGROUND: Genital infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis are the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Screening of sexually active young adults to detect and treat asymptomatic infections might reduce chlamydia transmission and prevent reproductive tract morbidity, particularly pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, which can cause tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects and safety of chlamydia screening versus standard care on chlamydia transmission and infection complications in pregnant and non-pregnant women and in men. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, DARE, PsycINFO and Web of Science electronic databases up to 14 February 2016, together with World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also handsearched conference proceedings, contacted trial authors and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adult women (non-pregnant and pregnant) and men comparing a chlamydia screening intervention with usual care and reporting on a primary outcome (C. trachomatis prevalence, PID in women, epididymitis in men or incidence of preterm delivery). We included non-randomised controlled clinical trials if there were no RCTs for a primary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus or adjudication by a third reviewer. We described results in forest plots and conducted meta-analysis where appropriate using a fixed-effect model to estimate risk ratios (RR with 95% confidence intervals, CI) in intervention vs control groups. We conducted a pre-specified sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome, PID incidence, according to the risks of selection and detection bias. MAIN RESULTS: We included six trials involving 359,078 adult women and men. One trial was at low risk of bias in all six specific domains assessed. Two trials examined the effect of multiple rounds of chlamydia screening on C. trachomatis transmission. A cluster-controlled trial in women and men in the general population in the Netherlands found no change in chlamydia test positivity after three yearly invitations (intervention 4.1% vs control 4.3%, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09, 1 trial, 317,304 participants at first screening invitation, low quality evidence). Uptake of the intervention was low (maximum 16%). A cluster-randomised trial in female sex workers in Peru found a reduction in chlamydia prevalence after four years (adjusted RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98, 1 trial, 4465 participants, low quality evidence).Four RCTs examined the effect of chlamydia screening on PID in women 12 months after a single screening offer. In analysis of four trials according to the intention-to-treat principle, the risk of PID was lower in women in intervention than control groups, with little evidence of between-trial heterogeneity (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94, I2 7%, 4 trials, 21,686 participants, moderate quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis, the estimated effect of chlamydia screening in two RCTs at low risk of detection bias (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.17) was compatible with no effect and was lower than in two RCTs at high or unclear risk of detection bias (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.83).The risk of epididymitis in men invited for screening, 12 months after a single screening offer, was 20% lower risk for epididymitis than in those not invited; the confidence interval was wide and compatible with no effect (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.42, 1 trial, 14,980 participants, very low quality evidence).We found no RCTs of the effects of chlamydia screening in pregnancy and no trials that measured the harms of chlamydia screening. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence about the effects of screening on C. trachomatis transmission is of low quality because of directness and risk of bias. There is moderate quality evidence that detection and treatment of chlamydia infection can reduce the risk of PID in women at individual level. There is an absence of RCT evidence about the effects of chlamydia screening in pregnancy.Future RCTs of chlamydia screening interventions should determine the effects of chlamydia screening in pregnancy, of repeated rounds of screening on the incidence of chlamydia-associated PID and chlamydia reinfection in general and high risk populations."
0,Diagnosed Gonorrhea Among Privately Insured Women: Analysis of United States Claims Data.,10.1089/jwh.2023.0006,"Background: Gonorrhea incidence in the United States has risen by nearly 50% in the last decade, while screening rates have increased. Gonorrhea sequelae rates  could indicate whether increased gonorrhea incidence is due to better screening.  We estimated the association of gonorrhea diagnosis with pelvic inflammatory  disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy (EP), and tubal factor infertility (TFI) in  women and detected changes in associations over time. Materials and Methods: This  retrospective cohort study included 5,553,506 women aged 18-49 tested for  gonorrhea in the IBM MarketScan claims administrative database from 2013-2018 in  the United States. We estimated incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) of  gonorrhea diagnosis for each outcome, adjusting for potential confounders using  Cox proportional hazards models. We tested the interaction between gonorrhea  diagnosis and the initial gonorrhea test year to identify changes in associations  over time. Results: We identified 32,729 women with a gonorrhea diagnosis (mean  follow-up time in years: PID = 1.73, EP = 1.75, TFI = 1.76). A total of 131,500  women were diagnosed with PID, 64,225 had EP, and 41,507 had TFI. Women with  gonorrhea diagnoses had greater incidence per 1000 person-years for all outcomes  (PID = 33.5, EP = 9.4, TFI = 5.3) compared to women without gonorrhea diagnoses  (PID = 13.9, EP = 6.7, TFI = 4.3). After adjustment, HRs were higher in women  with a gonorrhea diagnosis vs. those without [PID = 2.29 (95% confidence  interval, CI: 2.15-2.44), EP = 1.57, (95% CI: 1.41-1.76), TFI = 1.70 (95% CI:  1.47-1.97)]. The interaction of gonorrhea diagnosis and test year was not  significant, indicating no change in relationship by initial test year.  Conclusion: The relationship between gonorrhea and reproductive outcomes has  persisted, suggesting a higher disease burden."
0,A qualitative concept elicitation study to understand patient-reported symptoms and impacts of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in the United States.,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001958,"BACKGROUND: Gonorrhea is the second most common bacterial sexually-transmitted infection in the United States (US), with rising rates. Emerging antimicrobial  resistance threatens public health; and vaccines are in development. This study  documents patient-reported gonorrhea symptoms and health-related quality of life  (HRQoL) impact, in women who have sex with men (WSM), men who have sex with women  (MSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative  interviews were conducted (April 2021-March 2022) among US adults with recent (≤6  months) confirmed gonorrhea. Concept saturation was achieved, confirming adequate  participant numbers to meet objectives. Elicited symptom and HRQoL impacts were  used to develop a conceptual disease model. Common patient-reported outcome  measure (PROM) items were compared to elicited concepts. RESULTS: 32 participants  (15 WSM, 8 MSW and 9 MSM) were included. Eight were asymptomatic; six had repeat  infections; five women and four men had complications (i.e., infertility or  pelvic inflammatory disease [PID], and urethritis, respectively).The most  frequently reported symptoms were vaginal discharge (n = 11/12), dysuria (n =  10/12), and abdominal/vaginal pain (n = 9/12) for symptomatic WSM; dysuria (n =  5/6) and penile discharge (n = 4/6) for symptomatic MSW; and throat, testicular  or rectal pain (n = 4/6) for symptomatic MSM. All (symptomatic and asymptomatic)  participants reported HRQoL impacts including negative emotional experiences (n =  31/32), and interference with sexual activity (n = 30/32), relationships (n =  24/32) and social life (n = 17/32). Concepts were poorly represented in existing  PROMs. CONCLUSION: Participants reported a diverse range of symptoms and HRQoL  impacts, to help inform the value of new treatment and prevention options. More  research is needed to quantify patient burden and develop PROMs."
0,Gentamicin as an alternative to ceftriaxone in the treatment of gonorrhoea: the G-TOG non-inferiority RCT,10.3310/hta23200,"BACKGROUND: Gonorrhoea is a common sexually transmitted infection that can cause pain and discomfort, affect fertility in women and lead to epididymo-orchitis in men. Current treatment is with ceftriaxone, but there is increasing evidence of antimicrobial resistance reducing its effectiveness. Gentamicin is a potential alternative treatment requiring further evaluation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of gentamicin as an alternative treatment to ceftriaxone in the treatment of gonorrhoea. DESIGN: A multicentre, parallel-group, blinded, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Fourteen sexual health clinics in England. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 16-70 years with a diagnosis of uncomplicated, untreated genital, pharyngeal or rectal gonorrhoea based on a positive Gram-stained smear on microscopy or a positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING: Participants were randomised using a secure web-based system, stratified by clinic. Participants, investigators and research staff assessing participants were blinded to treatment allocation. INTERVENTIONS: Allocation was to either 240 mg of gentamicin (intervention) or 500 mg of ceftriaxone (standard treatment), both administered as a single intramuscular injection. All participants also received 1 g of oral azithromycin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was clearance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae at all infected sites, confirmed by a negative Aptima Combo 2® (Hologic Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA) NAAT, at 2 weeks post treatment. RESULTS: We randomised 720 participants, of whom 81% were men. There were 358 participants in the gentamicin group and 362 in the ceftriaxone group; 292 (82%) and 306 (85%) participants, respectively, were included in the primary analysis. Non-inferiority of gentamicin to ceftriaxone could not be demonstrated [adjusted risk difference for microbiological clearance -6.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -10.4% to -2.4%]. Clearance of genital infection was similar in the two groups, at 94% in the gentamicin group and 98% in the ceftriaxone group, but clearance of pharyngeal infection and rectal infection was lower in the gentamicin group (80% vs. 96% and 90% vs. 98%, respectively). Reported pain at the injection site was higher for gentamicin than for ceftriaxone. The side-effect profiles were comparable between the groups. Only one serious adverse event was reported and this was deemed not to be related to the trial medication. The economic analysis found that treatment with gentamicin is not cost neutral compared with standard care, with average patient treatment costs higher for those allocated to gentamicin (£13.90, 95% CI £2.47 to £37.34) than to ceftriaxone (£6.72, 95% CI £1.36 to £17.84). LIMITATIONS: Loss to follow-up was 17% but was similar in both treatment arms. Twelve per cent of participants had a negative NAAT for gonorrhoea at their baseline visit but this was balanced between treatment groups and unlikely to have biased the trial results. CONCLUSIONS: The trial was unable to demonstrate non-inferiority of gentamicin compared with ceftriaxone in the clearance of gonorrhoea at all infected sites. Clearance at pharyngeal and rectal sites was lower for participants allocated to gentamicin than for those allocated to ceftriaxone, but was similar for genital sites in both groups. Gentamicin was associated with more severe injection site pain. However, both gentamicin and ceftriaxone appeared to be well tolerated. FUTURE WORK: Exploration of the genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae will help to identify accurate markers of decreased susceptibility. Greater understanding of the immune response to infection can assist gonococcal vaccine development. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN51783227.

1,Gentamicin versus ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea (G-TOG trial): study protocol for a randomised trial,10.1186/s13063-016-1683-8,"BACKGROUND: Gonorrhoea is a common sexually transmitted infection which causes genital pain and discomfort; in women it can also lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility, and in men to epididymo-orchitis. Current treatment is with ceftriaxone, but there is increasing evidence of antimicrobial resistance which is reducing its effectiveness against gonorrhoea. A small, but increasing, number of patients have already been found to have highly resistant strains of gonorrhoea which has been associated with clinical failure. This trial aims to determine whether gentamicin is not clinically worse than ceftriaxone in the treatment of gonorrhoea. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a blinded, two-arm, multicentre, noninferiority randomised trial. Patients are eligible if they are aged 16-70 years with a diagnosis of genital, pharyngeal and/or rectal gonorrhoea. Exclusion criteria are: known concurrent sexually transmitted infection(s) (excluding chlamydia); bacterial vaginosis and/or Trichomonas vaginalis infection; contraindications or an allergy to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin or lidocaine; pregnancy or breastfeeding; complicated gonorrhoeal infection; weight under 40 kg; use of ceftriaxone, gentamicin or azithromycin within the preceding 28 days. Randomisation is to receive a single intramuscular injection of either gentamicin or ceftriaxone, all participants receive 1 g oral azithromycin as standard treatment. The estimated sample size is 720 participants (noninferiority limit 5%). The primary outcome is clearance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae at all infected sites by a negative Nucleic Acid Amplification Test, 2 weeks post treatment. Secondary outcomes include clinical resolution of symptoms, frequency of adverse events, tolerability of therapy, relationship between clinical effectiveness and antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration for N. gonorrhoeae, and cost-effectiveness. DISCUSSION: The options for future treatment of gonorrhoea are limited. Results from this randomised trial will demonstrate whether gentamicin is not clinically worse than ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea. This will inform clinical practice and policy for the treatment of gonorrhoea when current therapy with cephalosporins is no longer effective, or is contraindicated.

0,"Epstein-Barr Virus, High-Risk Human Papillomavirus and Abnormal Cervical Cytology in a Prospective Cohort of African Female Sex Workers",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000857,"BACKGROUND: High-oncogenic-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is necessary, although insufficient, to promote cervical cancer. Like HPV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common pathogen with the capacity to promote epithelial neoplasms. We examined the association between cervical EBV, hrHPV, and cytology in female sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya. METHODS: Women (n = 332) with known cervical cytology and hrHPV mRNA results were evaluated for cervical EBV DNA by conventional polymerase chain reaction. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated to assess the relationships between EBV, hrHPV, and cervical cytology. Prospective analyses used risk ratios and time-to-event analyses to determine the association of EBV with hrHPV clearance and with abnormal cytology outcomes. RESULTS: Baseline prevalence of hrHPV and EBV was 29% and 19%, respectively. Higher EBV prevalence was found among women with older age, HIV, hrHPV, abnormal cytology, Mycoplasma genitalium infection, smoking habits, younger age at sexual debut, and less frequent condom use. At baseline, women with EBV had a higher prevalence of hrHPV infection than did EBV-negative women (52% vs. 24%; HIV-adjusted PR [95% confidence interval], 1.8 [1.3-2.6]). Epstein-Barr virus-positive women had a higher prevalence than did EBV-negative women of high-grade precancer (15% vs. 2%) and abnormal cytology (37% vs. 15%), although HIV- and hrHPV-adjusted associations were not significant (high-grade precancer: PR, 2.0 [0.7-5.9]; abnormal cytology: PR, 1.4 [0.9-2.2]). In prospective analyses, a marginal association was observed between baseline EBV detection and delayed hrHPV clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a possible role for EBV as a high-risk marker or cofactor for HPV-mediated cervical cancer development."

Chlamydia trachomatis infection may favor HPV infection and this, the development of cervical cancer. Both infections can lead to consequences on sexual and reproductive health. OBJECTIVE: To determine frequency of HPV and C. trachomatis in asymptomatic university women less than 25 years, associating them with number of sexual partners (n°SxP) and time of sexual activity (TSxA). Material andMethods: 151 cervical samples for HPV and C. trachomatis, were processed by conventional and in real time reaction polymerase chain. RESULTS: HPV 21, 8%, C. trachomatis 11, 2% and co-infection (HPV/C.trachomatis), 4.6%. Aimong HPV +, 80, 6% showed high risk HPV. The n°SxP was strongly associated with HPV. Aimong young coinfected HPV/C. trachomatis, 71.4% had 3 or more PSx. Chlamydia trachomatis was more frequent (64,7%) that HPV within range of 3-5 years according to the TSxA, Discussion: A high prevalence of HPV and C. trachomatis was observed. Young women with coinfection HPV/C. trachomatis could be a high-risk group need to monitor their infections. It suggests the implementation of university programs in education, counseling and prevention in sexual health."
0,Characterization of JAK2 V617F (1849 G > T) Mutation in Cervical Cancer Related to Human Papillomavirus and Sexually Transmitted Infections,10.15430/JCP.2018.23.2.82,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes that infect the genital tract play a main etiologic role in cervical cancer progression. Other environmental factors, such as sexually transmitted diseases and the host genetic pattern, contribute to infection persistence of the uterus and cervical epithelium in sustaining their malignancy. The Janus kinase 2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase in cell signaling process of tumor genesis. In the present study, JAK2 V167F mutation was distinguished in women with sexually transmitted infections, such as Herpes simplex virus 2, Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium and cervical cancer. METHODS: This case-control survey was performed on 195 liquid based cytology of women specimens. Fifty, 98, and 47 samples were from women with known cervical cancer, HPV positive and HPV negative, respectively. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, sexually transmitted infections detection and HPV genotyping were carried out using approved PCR- RFLP, in-house multiplex TaqMan Real Time PCR and the reverse dot blot hybridization assay. RESULTS: HPVs 6, 16, 18, 11, 31, and 51 were the most common genotypes. The prevalence rate of multiple HPV genotypes was 46.0% to 10.1%. Analysis of JAK2 V617F (1849 G > T) showed that prevalence of mutation was GG (65.1%), GA (34.9%), and TT (0%), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between this mutation and variables of population survey (P ≥ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The molecular epidemiology study on the genetic polymorphisms, i.e., JAK2 V617F and other single nucleotide polymorphisms as a diagnostic tool is necessary for cancer screening and prophylactic programs."
0,Association between high risk human papillomavirus infection and co-infection with Candida spp. and Trichomonas vaginalis in women with cervical premalignant and malignant lesions,10.1016/j.jcv.2016.12.007,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the necessary cause of cervical cancer. Cervico-vaginal infection with pathogens like Chlamydia is a likely cofactor. The interactions between HPV, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and Candida spp. are less understood, though inflammation induced by these pathogens has been demonstrated to facilitate oncogenesis. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate the association between Candida spp. and TV co-infection with HPV in cervical oncogenesis. STUDY DESIGN: Women with normal cervix who were high-risk HPV-negative (N=104) and HPV-positive (N=105); women with CIN 1 (N=106) and CIN 2/CIN 3 (N=62) were recruited from a community based cervical cancer screening program. Cervical cancer patients (N=106) were recruited from a tertiary care oncology clinic. High-risk HPV was detected by Hybrid Capture II technique; Candida spp. and TV were detected by culturing the high vaginal swabs followed by microscopic examination in all. The disease status was established by histopathology in all the women. RESULT: HPV-positive women had significantly higher risk of having precursor lesions (of any grade) and cancer compared to HPV-negative women. Candida spp. or TV infection did not alter the risk of low grade or high grade lesions among HPV- positive women. HPV positive women co-infected with TV had higher risk of cervical cancer but not those co-infected with Candida spp. CONCLUSION: The higher risk of cancer observed in the women co-infected with HPV and TV without any enhanced risk of CIN 3 suggests secondary infection of the malignant growth by TV rather than any causal role. Co-infection with Candida spp. and/or TV infection did not increase the carcinogenic effect of HPV on cervix."
0,Suspected gonorrhea and chlamydia: Incidence and utilization of empiric antibiotics in a health system emergency department,10.1016/j.ajem.2018.08.015,"BACKGROUND: In the ED, patients are treated empirically for suspected gonorrhea and/or chlamydia (GC). Limited studies have evaluated the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in conjunction with predictor variables. This study will allow providers to better identify patients with potential GC to streamline antibiotic treatment. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the incidence of positive assay in patients that underwent GC screening. The secondary objectives included the proportion of patients assayed that received empiric therapy and the predictive value of risk factors to identify positive assays. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients who presented to the health-system EDs and underwent GC screening. Subjects were excluded if they were victims of sexual assault, left AMA or eloped. RESULTS: A total of 490 assayed patients were included, of which 84 (17%) were found to be positive for GC assay. Of the 278 patients treated empirically, 74% had a negative assay. Of the entire sample (n = 490), risk factors found to predict a positive assay (p < 0.05) included male, women <25 years of age, concomitant bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease or trichomonas, penile discharge, inconsistent condom use, previous/coexisting STDs, and uninsured. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to previous reports, this study found a higher incidence of positive GC assays for patients with suspected infection. This is the first study to evaluate GC testing in both men and women in the ED, and risk factors not previously reported by the CDC were identified."
1,Repeat Chlamydia Diagnoses Increase the Hazard of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease among US Army Women: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000878,"BACKGROUND: In the US military, chlamydia is the mostly commonly diagnosed bacterial sexually transmitted infection and the rates of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) have remained high since the early 2000s. METHODS: The relationship between the number of chlamydia diagnoses and hazard of PID was investigated in a retrospective cohort analysis among US Army women from 2006 to 2012. Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios for associations between the number of repeat chlamydia diagnoses and PID. RESULTS: The study population comprised 33,176 women with chlamydia diagnosis. Of these, 25,098 (75%) were diagnosed only once (""nonrepeaters""). By comparison, 6282 (19%), 1435 (4%), and 361 (1%) women had one, two and three repeat chlamydia diagnoses, respectively. Among these 4 groups, 1111, 325, 72, and 25 PID diagnoses were noted. According to the Cox regression analysis, for every additional diagnosis of chlamydia, the hazard of PID increased by 28% (95% confidence interval, 19%-38%) compared with women with a single diagnosis or nonrepeaters. Moreover, the corresponding adjusted hazard ratio of 1.28, 1.35, and 1.97 represented a significantly greater risk for PID among the three ""repeater"" groups compared with nonrepeaters. CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased hazard of PID among US Army women with repeat chlamydia diagnoses and the characterization of a dose-response relationship. These findings reinforce the notion that early diagnosis and treatment of chlamydia is necessary to avoid subsequent PID and associated morbidity."
0,"The Cervicovaginal Microbiota in Women Notified for Chlamydia trachomatis Infection: A Case-Control Study at the Sexually Transmitted Infection Outpatient Clinic in Amsterdam, The Netherlands",10.1093/cid/ciw586,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that the cervicovaginal microbiota (CVM) plays an important role in acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Here we study the CVM in a population of women notified by a sex partner for Chlamydia trachomatis infection. METHODS: We included 98 women who were contact-traced by C. trachomatis-positive sex partners at the STI outpatient clinic in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and analyzed their cervicovaginal samples and clinical data. CVMs were characterized by sequencing the V3/V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene and by hierarchical clustering. Characteristics associating with C. trachomatis infection were examined using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The CVM was characterized for 93 women, of whom 52 tested C. trachomatis positive and 41 C. trachomatis negative. We identified 3 major CVM clusters. Clustered CVM predominantly comprised either diverse anaerobic bacteria (n = 39 [42%]), Lactobacillus iners (n = 32 [34%]), or Lactobacillus crispatus (n = 22 [24%]). In multivariable analysis, we found that CVM was significantly associated with C. trachomatis infection (odds ratio [OR], 4.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.2-15.4] for women with diverse anaerobic CVM and OR, 4.4 [95% CI, 1.3-15.6], for women with L. iners-dominated CVM, compared with women with L. crispatus-dominated CVM), as was younger age (OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.1-8.7] for those ≤21 years old) and reporting a steady sex partner (OR, 3.6 [95% CI, 1.4-9.4]). CONCLUSIONS: Women who tested positive for Chlamydia trachomatis infection after having been contact-traced by a chlamydia-positive partner were more likely to have CVM dominated by L. iners or by diverse anaerobic bacteria, than by L. crispatus."
1,"Smoking, poor nutrition, and sexually transmitted infections associated with pelvic inflammatory disease in remote North Queensland Indigenous communities, 1998-2005",10.1186/s12905-015-0188-z,"BACKGROUND: Indigenous women in remote North Queensland have a high prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and associated health conditions such as sexual transmitted infections (STI). The association of severe pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with these factors has not been studied. The purpose of this study is to associate the factors with severe PID, as indicated by hospitalization in a high risk population in North Queensland Indigenous communities. METHODS: A cross-sectional association of 1445 Indigenous women using linked hospital separation and survey data during 1998-2005. RESULTS: The mean age of participating women was 37.4 years, 60% were of Aboriginal and 40% were Torres Strait Island (TSI) people. More than half of them (52.5%) were smokers, 9.3% had chlamydia and 2.6% had gonorrhoea with the overall prevalence of STI among those less than 25 years of age being 23.9%. Among the 47 participants diagnosed with PID in the study period, 42.5% were under 25 years and 95.7% (45 cases) were under 55 years (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-4.1 among women younger than 25 compared to those 25 years and over). PID was strongly associated with smoking (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-9.2) independent of age, ethnicity, STI and folate status. Low red cell folate increased PID hospitalization by 4 times (95% CI 1.5-13.2 of lowest quartile compared to the highest quartile) regardless of age. Having a STI significantly increased the likelihood of severe PID by 2.2 times (95% CI: 1.03-4.5) in Indigenous women younger than 45 years, independent of smoking and folate level. The risk of PID hospitalization was higher for gonorrheal infections (OR 3.2, 955 CI 1.1-9.6) compared to chlamydial infections (OR 1.5 95% CI 0.7-3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Young Indigenous women in North Queensland communities are at very high risk for STI and PID. Smoking, low folate, and STI are clustered, and are associated with PID hospitalizations. Much of this can be prevented with improved nutrition and access to preventive services, especially tobacco control, regular STI screening and treatment, as well as more investment in sexual health education and awareness."
0,Microbiota and gut ultrastructure of Anisakis pegreffii isolated from stranded cetaceans in the Adriatic Sea,10.1186/s13071-019-3636-z,"BACKGROUND: Inferring the microbiota diversity of helminths enables depiction of evolutionarily established ecological and pathological traits that characterize a particular parasite-host interaction. In turn, these traits could provide valuable information for the development of parasitosis control and mitigation strategy. The parasite Anisakis pegreffii (Nematoda: Anisakidae) realizes the final stage of its life-cycle within gastric chambers of aquatic mammals, causing mild-to-moderate granulomatous gastritis with eosinophilic infiltrate, to severe ulcerative gastritis with mixed inflammatory infiltrate, often associated with bacterial colonies. However, its interaction with the host microbiota remains unknown, and might reveal important aspects of parasite colonization and propagation within the final host. METHODS: MySeq Illumina sequencing was performed for the 16S rRNA gene from microbiota isolated from larvae, and uterus and gut of adult A. pegreffii parasitizing stranded striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba). To assess the potential presence of Brucella ceti within isolated microbiota, Brucella-targeted real-time PCR was undertaken. In addition, TEM of the gastrointestinal tract of the infective third-stage (L3) and transitioning fourth-stage larvae (L4) was performed to characterize the morphological differences and the level of larval feeding activity. RESULTS: In total, 230 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified across all samples (n = 20). The number of shared taxa was lower than the number of taxa found specifically in each parasite stage or organ. The dominant taxon was Mycoplasmataceae (genus Mycoplasma) in the gut and uterus of adult A. pegreffii, whereas Fusobacteriaceae (genus Cetobacterium) was the most abundant in 40% of larvae, alongside Mycoplasmataceae. No B. ceti DNA was detected in any of the microbiota isolates. TEM revealed differences in gut ultrastructure between L3 and L4, reflecting a feeble, most likely passive, level of feeding activity in L3. CONCLUSIONS: Microbiota from L3 was more related to that of the gut rather than the uterus of adult A. pegreffii. Taxa of the larval microbiota showed qualitative and quantitative perturbations, likely reflecting the propagation through different environments during its life-cycle. This suggests an ontogenetic shift in the alpha and beta diversity of microbial communities from uterus-derived towards cetacean-derived microbiota. Although TEM did not reveal active L3 feeding, microbiota of the latter showed similarity to that of an actively feeding adult nematode."
0,Best practices to minimize risk of infection with intrauterine device insertion,10.1016/S1701-2163(15)30636-8,"BACKGROUND: Intrauterine devices provide an extremely effective, long-term form of contraception that has the benefit of being reversible. Historically, the use of certain intrauterine devices was associated with increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. More recent evidence suggests that newer devices do not carry the same threat; however, certain risk factors can increase the possibility of infection. OBJECTIVES: To review the risk of infection with the insertion of intrauterine devices and recommend strategies to prevent infection. OUTCOMES: The outcomes considered were the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, the impact of screening for bacterial vaginosis and sexually transmitted infections including chlamydia and gonorrhea; and the role of prophylactic antibiotics. EVIDENCE: Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library on July 21, 2011, using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., intrauterine devices, pelvic inflammatory disease) and key words (e.g., adnexitis, endometritis, IUD). An etiological filter was applied in PubMed. The search was limited to the years 2000 forward. There were no language restrictions. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the web sites of national and international medical specialty societies. VALUES: The quality of evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care (Table). Recommendations 1. All women requesting an intrauterine device should be counselled about the small increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease in the first 20 days after insertion. (II-2A) 2. All women requesting an intrauterine device should be screened by both history and physical examination for their risk of sexually transmitted infection. Women at increased risk should be tested prior to or at the time of insertion; however, it is not necessary to delay insertion until results are returned. (II-2B) 3. Not enough current evidence is available to support routine screening for bacterial vaginosis at the time of insertion of an intrauterine device in asymptomatic women. (II-2C) 4. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics is not recommended prior to intrauterine device insertion, although it may be used in certain high-risk situations. (I-C) 5. Standard practice includes cleansing the cervix and sterilizing any instruments that will be used prior to and during insertion of an intrauterine device. (III-C) 6. In treating mild to moderate pelvic inflammatory disease, it is not necessary to remove the intrauterine device during treatment unless the patient requests removal or there is no clinical improvement after 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment. In cases of severe pelvic inflammatory disease, consideration can be given to removing the intrauterine device after an appropriate antibiotic regimen has been started. (I-B) 7. An intrauterine device is a safe, effective option for contraception in an HIV-positive woman. (I-B) 8. An intrauterine device can be considered a first-line contraceptive agent in adolescents. (I-A)."
1,Chlamydia public health programs and the epidemiology of pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy,10.1093/infdis/jis644,"BACKGROUND: Many countries have witnessed a disturbing increase in cases of Chlamydia trachomatis infection despite enhanced control programs. Since the goal of Chlamydia control is to prevent reproductive complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy, an understanding of recent trends in these conditions is needed to fully evaluate the effect of control efforts. METHODS: We analyzed 2 provincial, comprehensive health services administrative databases (encompassing hospitalizations and all physician-delivered services) for pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy trends from 1992 through 2009 in women of reproductive age in British Columbia, Canada. Trends were compared to provincial Chlamydia surveillance data by time-series analysis, using the cross-correlation function method and Granger causality testing. RESULTS: Chlamydia cases substantially increased from 1992 through 2009. Inpatient, outpatient, and total diagnoses of pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy declined from 1992 through 2003. After 2003, pelvic inflammatory disease rates continued to fall, while ectopic pregnancy rates significantly increased. The male Chlamydia urethritis rate increased from 39.4 to 173.6 cases/100,000 from 1996 to 2009. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of increasing Chlamydia infection rates, the reproductive complications of Chlamydia infection in women are declining overall. A recent increase in rates of ectopic pregnancies is cause for concern."
1,A prospective assessment of pelvic infection risk following same-day sexually transmitted infection testing and levonorgestrel intrauterine system placement,10.1016/j.ajog.2016.05.017,"BACKGROUND: Misperceptions persist that intrauterine device placement is related to pelvic infections and Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing results are needed prior to placement. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the relationship of Chlamydia and gonorrhea screening to pelvic infection for up to 2 years following placement of the levonorgestrel 52-mg intrauterine system. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1751 nulliparous and multiparous females 16 to 45 years old enrolled in a multicenter trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new levonorgestrel intrauterine system for up to 7 years. Participants had Chlamydia screening at study entry and yearly if they were age ≤25 years. Women also had baseline gonorrhea screening if testing had not been performed since starting their current sexual relationship. Those who changed sexual partners during the trial had repeated Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing. Intrauterine system insertion could occur on the same day as screening. Participants did not receive prophylactic antibiotics for intrauterine system placement. Investigators performed pelvic examinations after 12 and 24 months and when clinically indicated during visits at 3, 6, and 18 months after placement and unscheduled visits. Pelvic infection included any clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease or endometritis. RESULTS: Most participants (n = 1364, 79.6%) did not have sexually transmitted infection test results available prior to intrauterine system placement. In all, 29 (1.7%) participants had positive baseline testing for a sexually transmitted infection (Chlamydia, n = 25; gonorrhea, n = 3; both, n = 1); 6 of these participants had known results (all with Chlamydia infection) prior to intrauterine system placement and received treatment before enrollment. The 23 participants whose results were not known at the time of intrauterine system placement received treatment without intrauterine system removal and none developed pelvic infection. The incidence of positive Chlamydia testing was similar among those with and without known test results at the time of intrauterine system placement (1.9% vs 1.5%, respectively, P = .6). Nine (0.5%) participants had a diagnosis of pelvic infection over 2 years after placement, all of whom had negative Chlamydia screening on the day of or within 1 month after intrauterine system placement. Infections were diagnosed in 3 participants within 7 days, 1 at 39 days, and 5 at ≥6 months. Seven participants received outpatient antibiotic treatment and 2 (diagnoses between 6-12 months after placement) received inpatient treatment. Two (0.1%) participants had intrauterine system removal related to infection (at 6 days and at 7 months after placement), both of whom only required outpatient treatment. CONCLUSION: Conducting Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing on the same day as intrauterine system placement is associated with a low risk of pelvic infection (0.2%). Over the first 2 years of intrauterine system use, infections are infrequent and not temporally related to intrauterine system placement. Pelvic infection can be successfully treated in most women with outpatient antibiotics and typically does not require intrauterine system removal. Women without clinical evidence of active infection can have intrauterine system placement and sexually transmitted infection screening, if indicated, on the same day."
0,Analytical Performance of Multiplex Real-Time PCR for Six Sexually Transmitted Pathogens,10.7754/clin.lab.2015.150413,"BACKGROUND: Most organisms that cause sexual transmitted diseases (STDs) are fastidious pathogens that are difficult to detect with conventional microbiological methods and the proportions of multiple infections were noted up to 39.3% among the STI-positive subjects. However, only a few multiplex PCR and multiplex real-time PCR tests that can screen more than six microorganisms that cause STDs have been assessed. METHODS: A total of 114 endocervical swabs (ThinPrep PAPTEST PreservCyt Solution, Hologic Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA) were collected from healthy Korean women. Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Mycoplasma hominis (MH), Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) were detected by uniplex PCR with Seeplex kits and by multiplex real-time PCR with Real-Q Kits (Biosewoom Inc., Seoul, Korea). To evaluate analytical sensitivity, plasmids containing target genes from CT, NG, MG, MH, UU, and TV were serially diluted five times with saline buffer and replicated eight times per dilution. RESULTS: Real-Q STIs Kit assays showed 100% sensitivity for detecting MH, MG, CT, TV, NG and 94.1% sensitivity for detecting UU. In addition, it showed 100% specificity for UU, MH, MG, CT, TV, and NG. The analytic sensitivity of UU (95% probit = 17.3 copy/μL, 95% CI = 11.6 to 138.6) and MH (95% probit = 30.9 copy/μL, 95% CI = 20.6 to 169.9) was relatively lower than for others pathogens. Thus, the cutoff Ct value of < 45 for UU and MH and a cutoff Ct value of < 38 for CT, MH, NG, TV could minimize differences in detection limit among the six STIs (95% probit values = 5.3 to 14.6) and to optimize overall diagnostic performance. CONCLUSIONS: For medical applications of a multiplex real-time PCR assay, one kind of cutoff value, which is according to manufacturer's instructions, was generally used without the consideration of lowest actual detectable concentration of each target substance. However, analytical performance at the low concentration limit often defines the ability of the test to diagnose disease and determine treatment endpoints. Therefore, suitable cutoffs for negative or positive screens by multiplex real-time PCR should be evaluated for accurate diagnosis."
0,Chlamydia trachomatis Coinfection Does Not Influence Mycoplasma genitalium Bacterial Load in Urogenital Samples.,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001752,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) is associated with urethritis in men and weakly associated with pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Mycoplasma  genitalium coinfections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis  (CT) are commonly reported; however, little is known about their interaction. One  study suggested that MG/NG coinfections might increase the bacterial load of NG,  which has been shown to have a higher transmission potential. As even less is  known about the impact of a simultaneous MG/CT infection, we assessed whether  patients with urogenital MG/CT coinfections have a higher bacterial load than  patients with a single infection. METHODS: There were 1673 urogenital samples  from patients from a population-based chlamydia study, and our sexually  transmitted infection clinic tested for both CT and MG. When positive, the load  was quantified. Nonparametric tests compared the CT and MG load, and linear  regression analyses tested the association of the CT and MG load within a  patient. RESULTS: In 60 MG-positive patients, MG load ranged from 1.7 to 6.0  log10 copies/ml, similar to the CT load distribution. Only 6 patients were  MG-positive and CT-negative, but the MG load distribution was similar to that of  CT-positive patients (n.s.). The MG and CT load was unrelated in coinfected  persons (n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: We found no correlation between the CT and MG load  in urogenital samples, and the MG load distribution was similar in CT-positive  and CT-negative patients. These results could have implications for the  transmission risk of these infections."
0,Mycoplasma genitalium in the US (MyGeniUS): Surveillance Data From Sexual Health Clinics in 4 US Regions.,10.1093/cid/ciad405,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) is on the CDC Watch List of Antimicrobial Resistance Threats, yet there is no systematic surveillance to monitor change.  METHODS: We initiated surveillance in sexual health clinics in 6 cities,  selecting a quota sample of urogenital specimens tested for gonorrhea and/or  chlamydia. We abstracted patient data from medical records and detected MG and  macrolide-resistance mutations (MRMs) by nucleic acid amplification testing. We  used Poisson regression to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95%  CIs, adjusting for sampling criteria (site, birth sex, symptom status). RESULTS:  From October-December 2020 we tested 1743 urogenital specimens: 57.0% from males,  46.1% from non-Hispanic Black persons, and 43.8% from symptomatic patients. MG  prevalence was 16.6% (95% CI: 14.9-18.5%; site-specific range: 9.9-23.5%) and  higher in St Louis (aPR: 1.9; 1.27-2.85), Greensboro (aPR: 1.8; 1.18-2.79), and  Denver (aPR: 1.7; 1.12-2.44) than Seattle. Prevalence was highest in persons <18  years (30.4%) and declined 3% per each additional year of age (aPR: .97;  .955-.982). MG was detected in 26.8%, 21.1%, 11.8%, and 15.4% of urethritis,  vaginitis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), respectively. It  was present in 9% of asymptomatic males and 15.4% of asymptomatic females, and  associated with male urethritis (aPR: 1.7; 1.22-2.50) and chlamydia (aPR: 1.7;  1.13-2.53). MRM prevalence was 59.1% (95% CI: 53.1-64.8%; site-specific range:  51.3-70.6%). MRMs were associated with vaginitis (aPR: 1.8; 1.14-2.85),  cervicitis (aPR: 3.5; 1.69-7.30), and PID cervicitis (aPR: 1.8; 1.09-3.08).  CONCLUSIONS: MG infection is common in persons at high risk of sexually  transmitted infections; testing symptomatic patients would facilitate appropriate  therapy. Macrolide resistance is high and azithromycin should not be used without  resistance testing."
1,"A Silent Epidemic: The Prevalence, Incidence and Persistence of Mycoplasma genitalium Among Young, Asymptomatic High-Risk Women in the United States",10.1093/cid/ciy025,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma genitalium can result in pelvic inflammatory disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We analyzed data collected from a prospective study of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV) to determine the natural history of M. genitalium. METHODS: Women aged 15-25 years, with asymptomatic BV and ≥2 risk factors for sexually transmitted infection were recruited from 10 sites throughout the United States. Vaginal swab samples were collected at enrollment and through home-based testing every 2 months over 12 months. M. genitalium nucleic acid amplification testing was performed for M. genitalium using transcription-mediated assays (Hologic). The prevalence, incidence, and persistence of M. genitalium, defined as all positive specimens during follow-up, were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were calculated using logistic and Poisson regression to evaluate participant characteristics associated with M. genitalium infection. RESULTS: Among 1139 women, 233 were M. genitalium positive, for a prevalence of 20.5% (95% CI, 18.2%-22.9%); 42 of 204 had persistent M. genitalium (20.6%). Among 801 M. genitalium-negative women at baseline, the M. genitalium incidence was 36.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 32.4-41.3). Black race (AOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.09-3.38), age ≤21 years (1.40; 1.03-1.91), and prior pregnancy (1.36; 1.00-1.85) were associated with prevalent M. genitalium; only black race was associated with incident M. genitalium (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: We identified high rates of prevalent, incident, and persistent M. genitalium infections among young, high-risk women with asymptomatic BV, supporting the need for clinical trials to evaluate the impact of M. genitalium screening on female reproductive health outcomes."
0,Mycoplasma genitalium Infections in Women Attending a Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic in New Orleans,10.1093/cid/ciy922,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma genitalium has been significantly and nonsignificantly associated with cervicitis, urethritis, or vaginal discharge. This study examined the associations of M. genitalium with selected sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors among women attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in New Orleans. METHODS: Women aged ≥18 years who presented to the New Orleans STD clinic provided sociodemographic data and sexual behavior; STI, obstetric, and gynecologic history; and urine, vaginal, endocervical, and rectal specimens. Specimens were tested for M. genitalium, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma species, and yeast. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was diagnosed by Nugent score, and cervicitis was defined as ≥30 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power microscopic field on a cervical Gram stain or yellow mucopus on an endocervical swab. RESULTS: Among 400 women studied, M. genitalium was independently significantly associated with age <25 years (P < .03) and with ≥2 sexual partners in the last 12 months (P < .003). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.75; P = .103), C. trachomatis (AOR, 1.43; P = .247), and T. vaginalis (AOR, 1.60; P = .120) independently increased the odds of infection with M. genitalium. Controlling for other STIs and BV, there was a positive trend for M. genitalium to predict cervicitis (AOR, 3.18 [95% confidence interval, .99-10.2]; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasma genitalium in our study displayed the clinical features of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, the 2 organisms that drive research agendas in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of bacterial STIs."
0,"Prevalence and Factors Associated With Mycoplasma genitalium Infection in At-Risk Female Adolescents in Bronx County, New York.",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001840,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma genitalium infection can adversely affect female reproductive health, but data are limited about prevalence and characteristics of  the infection in female adolescents. We employed a sensitive assay to detect M.  genitalium infection, and we describe its characteristics in a clinical sample of  women younger than 21 years. METHODS: We recruited females aged 13 to 20 years in  children's hospital clinics whose clinicians were testing for  chlamydia/gonorrhea. Participants completed a questionnaire providing  demographics, sexual history, and current symptoms. Urine/endocervical samples  were tested for chlamydia/gonorrhea and partitioned for M. genitalium testing  using Aptima M. genitalium assay. We reviewed records for the clinic visit to  document examination, diagnosis, and results of sexually transmitted infection  (STI) testing. We compared prevalence of M. genitalium infection by demographics,  sexual history, symptoms, and signs. RESULTS: Of 153 participants mean age 18.07  ± 1.68 years, 58% self-identified as Hispanic, 27% Black, 64%  straight/heterosexual, 27% bisexual, 1% gay/lesbian, 29% reported a prior STI  diagnosis. Prevalence of M. genitalium was 11.1% (17/153), 13 of 17 were  asymptomatic, 2 of 17 had pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), 3 of 17 coinfected  with chlamydia or gonorrhea. Prevalence of chlamydia was 6.6% and of gonorrhea  2.6%. A logistic regression model indicated independent associations of bisexual  orientation versus all other orientations (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.80; 95%  confidence interval [CI], 1.38-16.67), self-reported prior STI (aOR, 3.83; 95%  CI, 1.10-13.37), and self-reported prior PID (aOR, 9.12; 95% CI, 1.02-81.72) with  higher odds of M. genitalium infection. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that in  at-risk female populations younger than 21 years, M. genitalium is a prevalent  STI and symptomatic adolescents may warrant testing and treatment. Further study  of harms and benefits of testing asymptomatic bisexual female adolescents or  those with prior STI/PID is needed."
0,Histological Evidence of Chronic Mycoplasma genitalium-Induced Cervicitis in HIV-Infected Women: A Retrospective Cohort Study,10.1093/infdis/jiw025,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma genitalium is an emerging sexually transmitted pathogen implicated in inflammatory syndromes of the female reproductive tract. The objective of this study was to investigate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women for an association between M. genitalium and cervicitis, a putative mechanism for enhanced HIV transmission efficiency to an uninfected partner. METHODS: Using a longitudinal cohort of antiretroviral therapy-adherent New Orleans women, we retrospectively screened for M. genitalium and quantitatively characterized several markers of cervical inflammation, including secreted cytokines and cytological and histological signs of leukocyte infiltration. RESULTS: We observed a high prevalence of M. genitalium (7.4%) among HIV-infected New Orleans women. Chronic M. genitalium infection was associated with increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8, and marked inflammatory cervical infiltrates in the cervix with enrichment of HIV target cells. Cure of M. genitalium infection resulted in ablation of all signs of inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings implicate M. genitalium as an etiologic agent of cervicitis in HIV-infected women, providing a potential mechanism for enhanced HIV transmission to an uninfected partner. Screening and treatment of M. genitalium among HIV-infected individuals may be warranted to further understand this coinfection scenario, improve cervical health, and reduce the spread of HIV."
0,"Prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium and Azithromycin-resistant Infections Among Remnant Clinical Specimens, Los Angeles",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000829,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma genitalium is an important cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases. Diagnosis and susceptibility testing of M. genitalium are limited by the fastidious nature of the organism. Therefore, the prevalence of infection and azithromycin resistance are poorly studied. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory study on remnant clinical specimens. We collected remnant DNA from consecutive urine samples and clinical swabs (cervical/vaginal, rectal, and pharyngeal) previously tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis using the Cobas 4800 CT/NG assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA) between March-April 2017 from across the University of California, Los Angeles Health System. We then retrospectively tested all specimens with the ResistancePlus MG (550) kit, a molecular assay for the detection of M. genitalium and genetic mutations associated with azithromycin resistance. RESULTS: Among 500 specimens, the prevalence of M. genitalium was 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04%-3.0%) in urine samples (n = 362), 17.4% (95% CI, 5.7%-39.6%) in rectal swabs (n = 23), and 1.9% (95% CI, 0.3%-7.3%) in cervical/vaginal swabs (n = 106). The prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae was 0.6% in urine samples and 4.3% in rectal swabs, whereas the prevalence of C. trachomatis was 2.2% in urine samples, 4.3% in rectal swabs and 3.8% in cervical/vaginal swabs. Of the 10 M. genitalium positive specimens, 8 (80.0%) had a mutation associated with azithromycin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of M. genitalium infection in our population varied by anatomic site of infection. Most M. genitalium infections had at least 1 mutation associated with azithromycin resistance."
0,Prevalence and Epidemiology of Mycoplasma genitalium in a Pacific-Region Military Population,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001393,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma genitalium is an important emerging sexually transmitted pathogen commonly causing urethritis in men, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women with potential of infertility. Accumulating evidence identifies the prevalence of M. genitalium similar to long recognized pathogens, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence and epidemiology of M. genitalium in a mid-Pacific military population. METHODS: A prospective analysis was conducted from routine specimens collected as standard of care for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing at Tripler Army Medical Center on Oahu, HI. The prevalence of M. genitalium was determined using the Aptima M. genitalium assay, a transcription-mediated amplification test. A multivariate analysis was performed to assess the associations for this infection with other STIs and demographic factors. RESULTS: A total of 1876 specimens were tested in a 6-month period including 6 sample types from 1158 females and 718 males. Subject ages ranged from 18 to 76 years, with a median of 24 years (interquartile range, 21-29 years). The prevalence of M. genitalium was 8.8% overall (n = 165), 7.1% in females and 11.6% in males. Coinfection with M. genitalium occurred with another sexually-transmitted pathogen in 43 patients (18.3%), with C. trachomatis as the most common organism (n = 38). CONCLUSIONS: These data contribute to the evidence base for M. genitalium and STI screening in an active-duty military."
1,Mycoplasma genitalium as a Cause of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,10.1016/j.jpag.2020.06.015,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma genitalium is an increasingly recognized cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). CASE: A 17-year-old female adolescent presented with chronic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. Test results for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea were negative, and multiple radiologic test results were normal. The patient failed several empiric courses of therapy over 1 year. Laparoscopy revealed findings consistent with PID. Nucleic acid amplification test results were positive for M genitalium. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: M genitalium causing PID can be challenging to diagnose because of its often atypical presentation. Further epidemiological studies are needed to understand the burden of disease and to establish testing and treatment guidelines."
0,"Mycoplasma genitalium incidence, persistence, concordance between partners and progression: systematic review and meta-analysis",10.1136/sextrans-2018-053823,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma genitalium is increasingly seen as an emerging sexually transmitted pathogen, and has been likened to Chlamydia trachomatis, but its natural history is poorly understood. The objectives of this systematic review were to determine M. genitalium incidence, persistence, concordance between sexual partners and the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, IndMed and African Index Medicus from 1 January 1981 until 17 March 2018. Two independent researchers screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We examined results in forest plots, assessed heterogeneity and conducted meta-analysis where appropriate. Risk of bias was assessed for all studies. RESULTS: We screened 4634 records and included 18 studies; six (4201 women) reported on incidence, five (636 women) on persistence, 10 (1346 women and men) on concordance and three (5139 women) on PID. Incidence in women in two very highly developed countries was 1.07 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0.61 to 1.53, I2 0%). Median persistence of M. genitalium was estimated from one to three months in four studies but 15 months in one study. In 10 studies measuring M. genitalium infection status in couples, 39%-50% of male or female sexual partners of infected participants also had M. genitalium detected. In prospective studies, PID incidence was higher in women with M. genitalium than those without (risk ratio 1.73, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.28, I2 0%, two studies). DISCUSSION: Incidence of M. genitalium in very highly developed countries is similar to that for C. trachomatis, but concordance might be lower. Taken together with other evidence about age distribution and antimicrobial resistance in the two infections, M. genitalium is not the new chlamydia. Synthesised data about prevalence, incidence and persistence of M. genitalium infection are inconsistent. These findings can be used for mathematical modelling to investigate the dynamics of M. genitalium. REGISTRATION NUMBERS: CRD42015020420, CRD42015020405."
0,"Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections detected by real-time PCR among individuals reporting sexual assaults in the Paris, France area",10.1016/j.forsciint.2016.04.031,"BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) are the most common bacteria involved in sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In France, combined screening for CT and NG using nucleic acid amplification tests is recommended in populations that are considered at risk. However, no data have been published about victims of sexual assaults. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the usefulness of real-time PCR for the rapid detection of CT and NG genomic DNA, and the prevalence of CT/NG infections in a sample of sexual assault victims examined at a department of forensic medicine. METHODS: Between July 2012 and July 2013, 326 adults and adolescents aged over 12 years reported a sexual assault and they were referred to the Department of Forensic Medicine for a medical and forensic examination. Secretions from urogenital (cervix or vagina), anorectal, or pharyngeal sites were collected for CT/NG assays. RESULTS: CT and NG were detected in 48/326 (15%) and 16/326 patients (5%), respectively, where 10 (3%) had a CT/NG co-infection. Among 48 patients with CT infection, 13 (27.1%) patients had co-occurring genital and anorectal infections. For the pharyngeal sites, 3/21 men (14.3%) were NG-positive. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high prevalence of CT and NG infections, systematic screening of both pathogens at the time of forensic examination should provide an opportunity for the early treatment of diagnosed STIs."
0,Gonococcal sepsis in a 32-year-old female: a case report,10.1186/s13104-018-3346-1,"BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a Gram-negative bacterium which affects the urethra, throat, rectum and cervix of patients and often associated with sexually transmitted infections. The global epidemiology of the disease is not well characterised especially in resource constraint countries due to poor diagnostic capacity and inefficient reporting systems. Although important, little is known about the propensity of this bacterium to cause sepsis in immunocompetent individuals. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old female presented with fever and generalised malaise to a rural hospital in Ghana. The patient had previously been diagnosed as having enteric fever from a neighbouring health facility. Blood and urine samples were collected from the patient and cultured using standard microbiological and molecular techniques. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from the blood which was resistant to penicillin, ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole. The patient recovered following ceftriaxone and azithromycin treatment. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of N. gonorrhoeae in causing sepsis and emphasises the need for blood culture investigation in diagnosis of patients presenting with fever."
0,Use of the mtrR Gene for Rapid Molecular Diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Identification of the Reduction of Susceptibility to Antibiotics in Endocervical Swabs,10.1007/s40291-018-0328-x,"BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae is one of the main etiological agents of sexually transmitted diseases. The asymptomatic course of the infection and its resistance to antibiotics can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. OBJECTIVES: We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test using the methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (mtrR) gene to identify N. gonorrhoeae and detect reduced susceptibility to antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed 250 samples of endocervical exudate from infertile women with a negative diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae. We designed NGmtr primers to detect N. gonorrhoeae and identify the antibiotic-resistant strain. RESULTS: Of the 250 samples, 60 (24%) tested positive for N. gonorrhoeae using real-time PCR. Our study was validated using the HO primers and the Seeplex STD6 ACE System, with a 100% correlation. Furthermore, the NGmtr primers are specific for N. gonorrhoeae and not for other species. Additionally, the curves generated by real-time PCR differed between wild and variant strains (10.93%). The dissociation temperatures for the wild and variant strains were 86.5 and 89 °C, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The NGmtr primers enabled us to identify N. gonorrhoeae strains with or without reduction of susceptibility to antibiotics. Therefore, this work constitutes a tool that will facilitate the diagnosis of this infection for a low cost and improve patient quality of life."
1,Pelvic inflammatory disease risk following negative results from chlamydia nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) versus non-NAATs in Denmark: A retrospective cohort,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002483,"BACKGROUND: Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) are the recommended test type for diagnosing Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia). However, less sensitive diagnostic methods-including direct immunofluorescence (IF) and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA)-remain in use in lower resourced settings. We estimate the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) following undiagnosed infection in women tested with non-NAATs and estimate the health gain from using accurate diagnostic tests. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used Denmark's national Chlamydia Study dataset to extract all chlamydia tests performed in women aged 15-34 years (1998-2001). Tests were categorised as non-NAAT (IF/ELISA) or NAAT and limited to each woman's first test in the study period. We linked test data to hospital presentations for PID within 12 months from the Danish National Patient Register. The study included 272,105 women with a chlamydia test, just under half (44.78%, n = 121,857) were tested using NAATs. Overall, 6.38% (n = 17,353) tested positive for chlamydia and 0.64% (n = 1,732) were diagnosed with PID within 12 months. The risk of PID following a positive chlamydia test did not differ by test type (NAAT 0.81% [95% CI 0.61-1.00], non-NAAT 0.78% [0.59-0.96]). The risk of PID following a negative test was significantly lower in women tested with NAATs compared to non-NAATs (0.55% [0.51-0.59] compared to 0.69% [0.64-0.73]; adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.83 [0.75-0.93]). We estimate that 18% of chlamydia infections in women tested with a non-NAAT were undiagnosed and that the risk of progression from undiagnosed chlamydia infection to PID within 12 months was 9.52% (9.30-9.68). Using non-NAATs could lead to an excess 120 cases of PID per 100,000 women tested compared to using NAATs. The key limitations of this study are under ascertainment of PID cases, misclassification bias in chlamydia and PID exposure status, bias to the association between clinical presentation and test type and the presence of unmeasured confounders (including other sexually transmitted infection [STI] diagnoses and clinical indication for chlamydia test). CONCLUSION: This retrospective observational study estimates the positive impact on women's reproductive health from using accurate chlamydia diagnostic tests and provides further evidence for restricting the use of inferior tests. Women with a negative chlamydia test have a 17% higher adjusted risk of PID by 12 months if they are tested using a non-NAAT compared to a NAAT."
0,"A Prospective Study of Exposure to Gender-Based Violence and Risk of Sexually Transmitted Infection Acquisition in the Women's Interagency HIV Study, 1995-2018",10.1089/jwh.2019.7972,"Background: Our objectives were to estimate the association of gender-based violence (GBV) experience with the risk of sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition in HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative women, to compare the STI risks associated with recent and lifetime GBV exposures, and to quantify whether these associations differ by HIV status. Methods: We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort study in the Women's Interagency HIV Study, 1994-2018. Poisson models were fitted using generalized estimating equations to estimate the association of past 6-month GBV experience (physical, sexual, or intimate partner psychological violence) with subsequent self-reported STI diagnosis (gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, pelvic inflammatory disease, or trichomoniasis). Results: Data from 2868 women who reported recent sexual activity comprised 12,069 person-years. Higher STI risk was observed among HIV-seropositive women (incidence rate [IR] 5.5 per 100 person-years) compared with HIV-seronegative women (IR 4.3 per 100 person-years). Recent GBV experience was associated with a 1.28-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99, 1.65) risk after adjustment for HIV status and relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and sexual risk variables. Other important risk factors for STI acquisition included unstable housing (adjusted incidence rate ratio [AIRR] 1.81, 95% CI 1.32-2.46), unemployment (AIRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14-1.76), transactional sex (AIRR 2.06, 95% CI 1.52-2.80), and drug use (AIRR 1.44, 95% CI 1.19-1.75). Recent physical violence contributed the highest risk of STI acquisition among HIV-seronegative women (AIRR 2.27, 95% CI 1.18-4.35), whereas lifetime GBV experience contributed the highest risk among HIV-seropositive women (AIRR 1.59, 95% CI 1.20-2.10). Conclusions: GBV prevention remains an important public health goal with direct relevance to women's sexual health."
0,"Association between visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid examination and high-risk human papillomavirus infection, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis in Papua New Guinea",10.1111/ajo.12783,"BACKGROUND: Papua New Guinea (PNG) has among the highest estimated burdens of cervical cancer globally but currently has no national cervical screening program. Visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA) is a low-cost screening strategy endorsed by the World Health Organization that has been adopted in many low-resource settings but not previously evaluated in PNG. AIM: To evaluate the association between VIA examination findings and high-risk HPV (hrHPV) infection; and the impact of concomitant genital Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis on the interpretation of VIA findings. METHODS: A prospective clinical cohort study among women aged 30-59 years attending Well Woman Clinics in PNG. Main outcome measures were VIA examination findings and laboratory-confirmed hrHPV, C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae and T. vaginalis. RESULTS: A total of 614 women were enrolled, of whom 87.5% (537/614) underwent VIA, and 12.5% (77/614) did not due to pre-existing cervicitis or inability to visualise the transformation zone. Among the 537 women who underwent VIA, 21.6% were VIA positive, 63.7% VIA negative, and 14.7% had indeterminate findings. The prevalence of hrHPV infection (n = 614) was 14.7%; C. trachomatis, 7.5%; N. gonorrhoeae, 8.0%; and T. vaginalis, 15.0%. VIA positive women were more likely to have HPV16 (odds ratio: 5.0; 95%CI: 1.6-15.6; P = 0.006) but there was no association between HPV18/45, all hrHPV types (combined), C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae or T. vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: VIA positivity was associated with HPV16, but not with other hrHPV infections, nor with genital C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae or T. vaginalis in this setting."
0,The relative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three contrasting approaches to partner notification for curable sexually transmitted infections: a cluster randomised trial in primary care,10.3310/hta19050,"BACKGROUND: Partner notification is the process of providing support for, informing and treating sexual partners of individuals who have been diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It is traditionally undertaken by specialist sexual health services, and may involve informing a partner on a patient's behalf, with consent. With an increasing proportion of STIs diagnosed in general practice and other community settings, there is a growing need to understand the best way to provide partner notification for people diagnosed with a STI in this setting using a web-based referral system. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare three different approaches to partner notification for people diagnosed with chlamydia within general practice. DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: General practices in England and, within these, patients tested for and diagnosed with genital chlamydia or other bacterial STIs in that setting using a web-based referral system. INTERVENTIONS: Three different approaches to partner notification: patient referral alone, or the additional offer of either provider referral or contract referral. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Number of main partners per index patient treated for chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea/non-specific urethritis/pelvic inflammatory disease; and (2) proportion of index patients testing negative for the relevant STI at 3 months. RESULTS: As testing rates for chlamydia were far lower than expected, we were unable to scale up the trial, which was concluded at pilot stage. We are not able to answer the original research question. We present the results of the work undertaken to improve recruitment to similar studies requiring opportunistic recruitment of young people in general practice. We were unable to standardise provider and contract referral separately; however, we also present results of qualitative work aimed at optimising these interventions. CONCLUSIONS: External recruitment may be required to facilitate the recruitment of young people to research in general practice, especially in sensitive areas, because of specific barriers experienced by general practice staff. Costs need to be taken into account together with feasibility considerations. Partner notification interventions for bacterial STIs may not be clearly separable into the three categories of patient, provider and contract referral. Future research is needed to operationalise the approaches of provider and contract partner notification if future trials are to provide generalisable information.

0,Antibodies Against Chlamydia trachomatis and Ovarian Cancer Risk in Two Independent Populations,10.1093/jnci/djy084,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has been associated with ovarian cancer risk. To clarify the role of Chlamydia trachomatis and other infectious agents in the development of ovarian cancer, we evaluated the association of serologic markers with incident ovarian cancer using a staged approach in two independent populations. METHODS: Studies included: 1) a case-control study in Poland (244 ovarian cancers/556 control subjects) and 2) a prospective nested case-control study in the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial (160 ovarian cancers/159 control subjects). Associations of serologic marker levels with ovarian cancer risk at diagnostic as well as higher thresholds, identified in Poland and independently evaluated in PLCO, were estimated using multivariable adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: In the Polish study, antibodies (based on laboratory cut-point) against the chlamydia plasmid-encoded Pgp3 protein (serological gold standard) were associated with increased ovarian cancer risk (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20 to 2.22); when a positive result was redefined at higher levels, ovarian cancer risk was increased (cut-point 2: OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.38 to 2.89; cut-point 3 [max OR]: OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.29 to 3.73). In the prospective PLCO study, Pgp3 antibodies were associated with elevated risk at the laboratory cut-point (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 0.78 to 2.63) and more stringent cut-points (cut-point 2: OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.07 to 4.71); cut-point 3: OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 0.63 to 10.08). In both studies, antibodies against other infectious agents measured were not associated with risk. CONCLUSIONS: In two independent populations, antibodies against prior/current C. trachomatis (Pgp3) were associated with a doubling in ovarian cancer risk, whereas markers of other infectious agents were unrelated. These findings lend support for an association between PID and ovarian cancer."
1,Pelvic inflammatory disease in the adolescent: understanding diagnosis and treatment as a health care provider,10.1097/PEC.0b013e318294dd7b,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a common clinical syndrome with highest rates in adolescents, but no studies have singularly focused on this population in relationship to established guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. The study objective was to assess knowledge of diagnosis and treatment criteria for PID within an adolescent population and to compare factors associated with adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines in outpatient settings. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a retrospective chart review of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections in adolescent women in an outpatient setting. Participant charts were eligible for review if they were 12 to 21 years of age and were given an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision/chart diagnosis of PID. Two primary outcome variables were utilized: meeting PID diagnosis guidelines (no/yes) and correct treatment for subject meeting criteria with guidelines (no/yes). The study controlled for race, age, medical venue, and current/past infection with gonorrhea/chlamydia. RESULTS: Subjects (n = 150) were examined for the primary outcome variables; 78% (117/150) met at least 1 criterion for PID diagnosis. Nearly 75% (111/150) had cervical motion tenderness, 34% (51/150) adnexal tenderness, and 5% (7/150) had uterine tenderness; nearly 11% (16/150) were positive for all 3 criteria. Symptoms associated with PID were compared for subjects meeting diagnosis criteria versus subjects not meeting diagnosis criteria: abdominal pain and vomiting were significantly associated with PID diagnosis at P < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that PID diagnosis/treatment often does not follow guidelines in the adolescent population. Pelvic inflammatory disease and cervicitis appear to be confused by providers in the diagnosis process, and educational tools may be necessary to increase the knowledge base of practitioners in regard to PID."
1,Proportion of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Cases Caused by Chlamydia trachomatis: Consistent Picture From Different Methods,10.1093/infdis/jiw178,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a leading cause of both tubal factor infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Chlamydia trachomatis is an important risk factor for PID, but the proportion of PID cases caused by C. trachomatis is unclear. Estimates of this are required to evaluate control measures. METHODS: We consider 5 separate methods of estimating age-group-specific population excess fractions (PEFs) of PID due to C. trachomatis, using routine data, surveys, case-control studies, and randomized controlled trials, and apply these to data from the United Kingdom before introduction of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme. RESULTS: As they are informed by randomized comparisons and national exposure and outcome estimates, our preferred estimates of the proportion of PID cases caused by C. trachomatis are 35% (95% credible interval [CrI], 11%-69%) in women aged 16-24 years and 20% (95% CrI, 6%-38%) in women aged 16-44 years in the United Kingdom. There is a fair degree of consistency between adjusted estimates of PEF, but all have wide 95% CrIs. The PEF decreases from 53.5% (95% CrI, 15.6%-100%) in women aged 16-19 years to 11.5% (95% CrI, 3.0%-25.7%) in women aged 35-44 years. CONCLUSIONS: The PEFs of PID due to C. trachomatis decline steeply with age by a factor of around 5-fold between younger and older women. Further studies of the etiology of PID in different age groups are required."
1,Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease,10.1002/14651858.CD010285.pub2,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection that affects 4% to 12% of young women, and is one of the most common causes of morbidity in this age group. The main intervention for acute PID is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and anaerobic bacteria, administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally. In this review, we assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2016, located through electronic searching and handsearching; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid platform (1991 to July 2016); MEDLINE (1946 to July 2016); Embase (1947 to July 2016); LILACS, iAHx interface (1982 to July 2016); World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2016); Web of Science (2001 to July 2016); OpenGrey (1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, and 1997); and abstracts in selected publications. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing the use of antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended for consideration by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for treatment of PID. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a fourth review author if necessary. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria, classifying it as high, moderate, low, or very low. We calculated Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR), using either random-effects or fixed-effect models and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome or for an additional harmful outcome, with their 95% confidence interval (CI), to measure the effect of the treatments. We conducted sensitivity analyses limited to studies at low risk of bias, for comparisons where such studies were available. MAIN RESULTS: We included 37 RCTs (6348 women). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. Azithromycin versus doxycyclineThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55, I2 = 72%, 2 RCTs, 243 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05, 1 RCT, 309 women, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34, 3 RCTs, 552 women, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67, 133 women, moderate-quality evidence). Quinolone versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10, 3 RCTs, 459 women, I2 = 5%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23, 2 RCTs, 313 women, I2 = 7%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72, 5 RCTs, 772 women, I2 = 0%, very low-quality evidence). Nitroimidazole versus no use of nitroimidazoleThere was no conclusive evidence of a difference between the nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) group and the group receiving other drugs with activity over anaerobes (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10, 5 RCTs, 2427 women, I2 = 60%, moderate-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01, 11 RCTs, 1383 women, I2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.59; participants = 3788; studies = 16; I2 = 0% , low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, findings did not differ substantially from the main analysis (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15, 2 RCTs, 1201 women, I2 = 32%, high-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinoloneThere was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13, 1 RCT, 25 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19, 2 studies, 151 women, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72, 3 RCTs, 163 women, very low-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09, 2 RCTs, 150 women, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06, 10 RCTs, 959 women, I2 = 21%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42, 10 RCTs, 1172 women, I2 = 0%, very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no conclusive evidence that one regimen of antibiotics was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of PID, and there was no clear evidence for the use of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) compared to use of other drugs with activity over anaerobes. Moderate-quality evidence from a single study at low risk of bias suggested that a macrolide (azithromycin) may be more effective than a tetracycline (doxycycline) for curing mild-moderate PID. Our review considered only the drugs that are currently used and mentioned by the CDC."
1,What Do Diagnoses of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease in Specialist Sexual Health Services in England Tell Us About Chlamydia Control?,10.1093/infdis/jiab175,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an outcome measure for the evaluation of chlamydia screening programs. We explore PID diagnoses in specialist sexual health services (SSHSs) in England to inform the evaluation of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme, which was implemented nationally in 2008. METHODS: We conducted descriptive analyses using data on diagnoses of PID-with and without Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC)-by age and year of birth, in SSHSs between 2009 and 2019 from the GUMCAD STI Surveillance System database. Rates were calculated per 100 000 females residing in England. RESULTS: CT screening activity peaked in 2010. The rates of all PID diagnoses decreased between 2009 and 2019 by 39%. CT-associated PID (CT-PID) declined by 58%, and nonspecific PID declined by 37%. GC-PID increased by 34%. CT-PID decreased across all age groups with the highest observed decline, 71%, in 15- to 19-year-olds. A dose-response relationship was observed between CT-PID rates and screening, with rates lowest in those with the greatest exposure to screening. CONCLUSIONS: There was a marked decline in diagnoses of CT-PID, and nonspecific PID, at SSHSs after the introduction of widespread chlamydia screening, whereas GC-PID diagnoses increased. This ecological trend was broadly consistent with what we would have expected to see if widespread screening reduced the incidence of chlamydia-associated PID (and of nonspecific PID), as has been observed in randomized controlled trials of screening."
1,Therapeutic Impact of Initial Treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis Among Patients With Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study Using a National Inpatient Database in Japan,10.1093/cid/ciy862,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is common among women of reproductive age and can be complicated by tuboovarian abscess (TOA), which is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease. However, recent mortality rates from PID on hospital admission and the short-term therapeutic usefulness of initial treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis remain unknown. METHODS: Using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, we identified patients who were diagnosed with PID on admission from July 2010 to March 2016 in Japan. We excluded patients who were pregnant, had cancer, or had missing data. Propensity score-adjusted analyses were performed to compare short-term outcomes between patients administered initial treatment for C. trachomatis and those without this treatment. The primary outcome was surgical intervention (laparotomy, laparoscopic surgery, and/or drainage procedure) during hospitalization. RESULTS: In total, 27841 eligible patients were identified. Of these patients, 2463 (8.8%) had TOA on admission. Mortality during hospitalization was 0.56% and 0.28% in the groups without and with TOA, respectively. Propensity score matching created 6149 pairs. A significant difference was observed in the primary outcome between those receiving initial treatment for C. trachomatis and the control group after propensity score matching (11.5% vs 13.4%; risk difference, -1.9%; 95% confidence interval, -3.1 to -0.7). The group that received initial treatment for C. trachomatis also had a significantly lower mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective nationwide study, initial treatment for C. trachomatis among hospitalized patients diagnosed with PID had clinical benefits in terms of improved short-term outcomes."
1,"Management of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease in Selected U.S. Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinics: Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Network, January 2010-December 2011",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000309,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) remains an important source of preventable reproductive morbidity, but no recent studies have singularly focused on US sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in relationship to established guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Of the 83,076 female patients seen in 14 STD clinics participating in the STD Surveillance Network, 1080 (1.3%) were diagnosed as having PID from 2010 to 2011. A random sample of 219 (20%) women were selected, and medical records were reviewed for clinical history, examination findings, treatment, and diagnostic testing. Our primary outcomes were to evaluate how well PID diagnosis and treatment practices in STD clinic settings follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) treatment guidelines and to describe age group-specific rates of laboratory-confirmed Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in patients clinically diagnosed as having PID in the last 12 months, inclusive of the PID visit. RESULTS: Among the 219 women, 70.3% of the cases met the CDC treatment case definition for PID, 90.4% had testing for CT and GC on the PID visit, and 68.0% were treated with a CDC-recommended outpatient regimen. In the last 12 months, 95.4% were tested for CT or GC, and positivity for either organism was 43.9% in women aged 25 years or younger with PID, compared with 19.4% of women older than 25 years with PID. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with CDC guidelines was documented for many of the women with PID, though not all. Our findings underscore the need for continued efforts to optimize quality of care and adherence to current guidance for PID management given the anticipated expertise of providers in these settings."
1,Direct and indirect effects of screening for Chlamydia trachomatis on the prevention of pelvic inflammatory disease: a mathematical modeling study,10.1097/EDE.0b013e31829e110e,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) results from the ascending spread of microorganisms, including Chlamydia trachomatis, to the upper genital tract. Screening could improve outcomes by identifying and treating chlamydial infections before they progress to PID (direct effect) or by reducing chlamydia transmission (indirect effect). METHODS: We developed a compartmental model that represents a hypothetical heterosexual population and explicitly incorporates progression from chlamydia to clinical PID. Chlamydia screening was introduced, with coverage increasing each year for 10 years. We estimated the separate contributions of the direct and indirect effects of screening on PID cases prevented per 100,000 women. We explored the influence of varying the time point at which clinical PID could occur and of increasing the risk of PID after repeated chlamydial infections. RESULTS: The probability of PID at baseline was 3.1% by age 25 years. After 5 years, the intervention scenario had prevented 187 PID cases per 100,000 women and after 10 years 956 PID cases per 100,000 women. At the start of screening, most PID cases were prevented by the direct effect. The indirect effect produced a small net increase in PID cases, which was outweighed by the effect of reduced chlamydia transmission after 2.2 years. The later that progression to PID occurs, the greater the contribution of the direct effect. Increasing the risk of PID with repeated chlamydial infection increases the number of PID cases prevented by screening. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the separate roles of direct and indirect PID prevention and potential harms, which cannot be demonstrated in observational studies."
1,"Trends in pelvic inflammatory disease emergency department visits, United States, 2006-2013",10.1016/j.ajog.2017.10.010,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease is a female genital tract disorder with severe reproductive sequelae. Because of the difficulties in diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease, it is not a reportable condition in many states. Females seeking care in emergency departments are a sentinel population for pelvic inflammatory disease surveillance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine trends in diagnoses of acute pelvic inflammatory disease in a nationally representative sample of emergency departments. STUDY DESIGN: All emergency department visits among females aged 15-44 years with an International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code indicating pelvic inflammatory disease during 2006-2013 were assessed from the HealthCare Utilization Project Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Total and annual percentage changes in the proportion of pelvic inflammatory disease emergency department visits were estimated using trend analyses. RESULTS: While the number of emergency department visits among females aged 15-44 years during 2006-2013 increased (6.5 million to 7.4 million), the percentage of visits due to pelvic inflammatory disease decreased from 0.57% in 2006 to 0.41% in 2013 (total percentage change, -28.4%; annual percent change, -4.3%; 95% confidence interval, -5.7% to -2.9%). The largest decreases were among those aged 15-19 years (total percent change, -40.6%; annual percentage change, -6.6%; 95% confidence interval, -8.6% to -4.4%) and living in the South (total percentage change, -38.0%; annual percentage change, -6.2%; 95% confidence interval, -7.8% to -4.6%). Females aged 15-19 years who lived in the South had a 47.9% decrease in visits due to pelvic inflammatory disease (annual percentage change, -8.4%, 95% confidence interval, -10.4 to -6.5). Patients living in ZIP codes with the lowest median income (<$38,000) had the highest percent of visits with a pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosis; the smallest declines over time were in patients living in ZIP codes with the highest median income (i.e., >$64,000, total percent change, -24.4%; annual percent change, -3.8%; 95% confidence interval, -5.2% to -2.4%). The percentage of emergency department visits due to pelvic inflammatory disease was highest among patients not charged for their visit, self-paying, or those covered by Medicaid, with total percentage changes in these 3 groups of -27.8%, -30.7%, and -35.1%, respectively. Patients with Medicaid coverage had the largest decrease in visits with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (total percent change, -35.1%; annual percent change, -5.8%; 95% confidence interval, -7.2% to -4.3%). CONCLUSION: Nationally representative data indicate the percentage of emergency department visits with a pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosis decreased during 2006-2013 among females aged 15-44 years, primarily driven by decreased diagnoses of pelvic inflammatory disease among females aged 15-19 years and among women living in the southern United States. Despite declines, a large number of females of reproductive age are receiving care for pelvic inflammatory disease in emergency departments. Patients with lower median income and no or public health insurance status, which may decrease access to and use of health care services, consistently had the highest percentage of emergency department visits due to pelvic inflammatory disease. Future research should focus on obtaining a better understanding of factors influencing trends in pelvic inflammatory disease diagnoses and ways to address the challenges surrounding surveillance for this condition."
1,Potential for Point-of-Care Tests to Reduce Chlamydia-associated Burden in the United States: A Mathematical Modeling Analysis,10.1093/cid/ciz519,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care testing (POCT) assays for chlamydia are being developed. Their potential impact on the burden of chlamydial infection in the United States, in light of suboptimal screening coverage, remains unclear. METHODS: Using a transmission model calibrated to data in the United States, we estimated the impact of POCT on chlamydia prevalence, incidence, and chlamydia-attributable pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) incidence, assuming status quo (Analysis 1) and improved (Analysis 2) screening frequencies. We tested the robustness of results to changes in POCT sensitivity, the proportion of patients getting treated immediately, the baseline proportion lost to follow-up (LTFU), and the average treatment delay. RESULTS: In Analysis 1, high POCT sensitivity was needed to reduce the chlamydia-associated burden. With a POCT sensitivity of 90%, reductions from the baseline burden only occurred in scenarios in which over 60% of the screened individuals would get immediate treatment and the baseline LTFU proportion was 20%. With a POCT sensitivity of 99% (baseline LTFU 10%, 2-week treatment delay), if everyone were treated immediately, the prevalence reduction was estimated at 5.7% (95% credible interval [CrI] 3.9-8.2%). If only 30% of tested persons would wait for results, the prevalence reduction was only 1.6% (95% CrI 1.1-2.3). POCT with 99% sensitivity could avert up to 12 700 (95% CrI 5000-22 200) PID cases per year, if 100% were treated immediately (baseline LTFU 20% and 3-week treatment delay). In Analysis 2, when POCT was coupled with increasing screening coverage, reductions in the chlamydia burden could be realized with a POCT sensitivity of 90%. CONCLUSIONS: POCT could improve chlamydia prevention efforts if test performance characteristics are significantly improved over currently available options."
1,Screening for gonorrhea and Chlamydia: a systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,10.7326/M14-1022,"BACKGROUND: Previous research has supported screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia in asymptomatic, sexually active women (including pregnant women) who are younger than 25 years or at increased risk but not in other patient populations. PURPOSE: To update the 2005 and 2007 systematic reviews for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force on screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia in men and women, including pregnant women and adolescents. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1 January 2004 to 13 June 2014), Cochrane databases (May 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: English-language trials and observational studies about screening effectiveness, test accuracy, and screening harms. DATA EXTRACTION: Extracted study data were confirmed by a second investigator, and study quality and applicability were dual-rated using prespecified criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: Screening a subset of asymptomatic young women for chlamydia in a good-quality trial did not significantly reduce the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease over the following year (relative risk, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.14 to 1.08]); however, 1 previous trial reported a reduction. An observational study evaluating a risk prediction tool to identify persons with chlamydia in high-risk populations had low predictive ability and applicability. In 10 new studies of asymptomatic patients, nucleic acid amplification tests demonstrated sensitivity of 86% or greater and specificity of 97% or greater for diagnosing gonorrhea and chlamydia, regardless of specimen type or test. LIMITATIONS: There were few relevant studies of screening benefits and harms. Only screening tests and methods cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for current clinical practice were included to determine diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSION: Chlamydia screening in young women may reduce the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease. Nucleic acid amplification tests are accurate for diagnosing gonorrhea and chlamydia in asymptomatic persons. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality."
0,Reduced Endometrial Ascension and Enhanced Reinfection Associated With Immunoglobulin G Antibodies to Specific Chlamydia trachomatis Proteins in Women at Risk for Chlamydia,10.1093/infdis/jiab496,"BACKGROUND: Previous research revealed antibodies targeting Chlamydia trachomatis elementary bodies was not associated with reduced endometrial or incident infection in C. trachomatis-exposed women. However, data on the role of C. trachomatis protein-specific antibodies in protection are limited. METHODS: A whole-proteome C. trachomatis array screening serum pools from C. trachomatis-exposed women identified 121 immunoprevalent proteins. Individual serum samples were probed using a focused array. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody frequencies and endometrial or incident infection relationships were examined using Wilcoxon rank sum test. The impact of the breadth and magnitude of protein-specific IgGs on ascension and incident infection were examined using multivariable stepwise logistic regression. Complementary RNA sequencing quantified C. trachomatis gene transcripts in cervical swab samples from infected women. RESULTS: IgG to pGP3 and CT_005 were associated with reduced endometrial infection; anti-CT_443, anti-CT_486, and anti-CT_123 were associated with increased incident infection. Increased breadth of protein recognition did not however predict protection from endometrial or incident infection. Messenger RNAs for immunoprevalent C. trachomatis proteins were highly abundant in the cervix. CONCLUSIONS: Protein-specific C. trachomatis antibodies are not sufficient to protect against ascending or incident infection. However, cervical C. trachomatis gene transcript abundance positively correlates with C. trachomatis protein immunogenicity. These abundant and broadly recognized antigens are viable vaccine candidates."
0,No indication for tissue tropism in urogenital and anorectal Chlamydia trachomatis infections using high-resolution multilocus sequence typing,10.1186/1471-2334-14-464,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that C. trachomatis strains found in MSM are different from those in heterosexuals. This study investigates whether the differences in strain distribution between MSM and heterosexuals are due to tissue tropism. METHODS: C. trachomatis positive samples were collected from MSM (anorectal) and women (anorectal, cervical, vaginal, pharyngeal) visiting the STI outpatient clinic of Amsterdam between 2008 and 2013. All samples were typed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Epidemiological data were derived from electronic patient records. RESULTS: We obtained full MLST data for C. trachomatis from 207 MSM and 185 women, all with anorectal infections. Six large clusters were identified of which 3 consisted predominantly of samples from women (89%-100%), whereas the other 3 consisted predominantly of samples from MSM (97%-100%). Furthermore, we obtained full MLST data from 434 samples of 206 women with concurrent infections at multiple anatomical locations. No association was observed between C. trachomatis cluster and the anatomical location of infection. CONCLUSION: We found no indication for tissue tropism in urogenital, pharyngeal and anorectal C. trachomatis infections. Combined with results from previously conducted studies, we hypothesize that MSM and heterosexuals have different distributions of C. trachomatis strains due to their separate sexual networks."
0,"Optimizing Screening for Anorectal, Pharyngeal, and Urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae Infections in At-Risk Adolescents and Young Adults in New Orleans, Louisiana and Los Angeles, California, United States",10.1093/cid/ciaa1838,"BACKGROUND: Public health organizations have inconsistent recommendations for screening adolescents and young adults for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections. Guidelines suggest different combinations of anorectal, pharyngeal, and urogenital testing based on age, sex, and sexual activity. Further evaluation of how identity and behaviors impact the anatomic distribution of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infection is needed to optimize future screening practices. METHODS: We assessed the positivity of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections at different anatomic sites in a cohort of at-risk sexually active adolescents and young adults aged 12-24 years in New Orleans, Louisiana and Los Angeles, California. Participants were tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae at 3 sites (anorectum, pharynx, and urethral/cervix) every 4 months using self-collected swabs. We stratified anatomic distributions of infection into 4 gender and sexual behavior categories: (1) cisgender men who have sex with men and transgender women (MSMTW); (2) cisgender heterosexual males; (3) cisgender heterosexual females; and (4) gender minorities assigned female at birth. RESULTS: While three-site testing detected all infections, two-site (anorectum and urethra/cervix) testing identified 92%-100% of C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae infections in participants assigned female at birth and cisgender heterosexual males. For MSMTW, two-site anorectal and pharyngeal testing vs single-site anorectal testing increased the proportion of individuals with either infection from 74% to 93%. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual behavior and gender identity may influence detection of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections at specific anatomic testing sites. Testing guidelines should incorporate sexual behavior and gender identity. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT03134833."
0,A rare case of large pyosalpinx in an elderly patient with well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus: a case report,10.1186/s13256-018-1841-6,"BACKGROUND: Pyosalpinx, which is one of the pelvic inflammatory diseases, is usually observed in young women; it is rarely found in older women. Possible causative agents are thought to be Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea in addition to some Enterobacteriaceae. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is a disease with a lot of complications such as hyperglycemia, inflammation, and immune disorders. Therefore, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased susceptibility to infection especially when glycemic control is poor. CASE PRESENTATION: We experienced a rare case of large pyosalpinx in an elderly patient with well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. A 72-year-old Japanese woman with a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus had symptoms of diarrhea and persistent pain in left lower abdomen. She had mild tenderness to palpation in her abdomen. Inflammation markers were markedly elevated. Her abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging on admission revealed a tumor in left side of intrapelvis and we diagnosed her as having pyosalpinx. Pathogenic bacteria were not detected. On admission, her glycemic control was relatively good; in addition, her glycated hemoglobin levels were around 6% for over 1 year. Although pathogenic bacteria were not detected, we started antibiotics therapy. Fourteen days after starting the antibiotics her laboratory data were improved. Three months later, the tumor was markedly smaller compared to that on admission. CONCLUSIONS: We should keep in mind that older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are immunocompromised hosts and thereby they could have rare pelvic inflammatory disease such as pyosalpinx even when good glycemic control is obtained for a long period of time."
1,"Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium prevalence and associated factors among women presenting to a pregnancy termination and contraception clinic, 2009-2019",10.1136/sextrans-2020-054695,"BACKGROUND: Risk of pelvic inflammatory disease associated with Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium is increased after termination of pregnancy (TOP) and may be increased after insertion of intrauterine devices (IUDs). Screening prior to these procedures is recommended only for C. trachomatis. We examined C. trachomatis and M. genitalium prevalence and associated factors among women presenting to a pregnancy termination and contraception service over 10 years. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical data collected from 17 573 women aged 15-45 years in 2009-2019 and for 266 M. genitalium positive women tested for macrolide resistance-associated mutations in 2016-2019. RESULTS: C. trachomatis and M. genitalium prevalence was 3.7% and 3.4%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, shared risk factors were younger age (p<0.001, for both C. trachomatis and M. genitalium), socioeconomic disadvantage (p=0.045 and p=0.008, respectively) and coinfection (p<0.001, for both sexually transmitted infections), with 10.1% of C. trachomatis positive women also positive for M. genitalium. Additional risk factors were earlier year of visit (p=0.001) for C. trachomatis and for M. genitalium residing outside a major city (p=0.013). The proportion of M. genitalium infections tested between 2016 and 2019 with macrolide resistance-associated mutations was 32.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high level of antimicrobial resistance and the prevalence of coinfection, testing C. trachomatis positive women for M. genitalium could be considered in this setting to prevent further spread of resistant infections. Further research is required into the causal link between M. genitalium and pelvic inflammatory disease in women undergoing TOP and IUD insertion."
1,Population effectiveness of opportunistic chlamydia testing in primary care in Australia: a cluster-randomised controlled trial,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31816-6,"BACKGROUND: Screening young adults who are sexually active for genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection is promoted in several high-income countries, but its effectiveness at the population level is highly debated. We aimed to investigate the effects of opportunistic chlamydia testing in primary care on the estimated chlamydia prevalence in the population aged 16-29 years in Australia. METHODS: We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial. Clusters were rural towns with a minimum of 500 women and men aged 16-29 years and no more than six primary care clinics. We randomly allocated each cluster using a computer-generated minimisation algorithm to receive a multifaceted, clinic-based chlamydia testing intervention or to continue usual care. The intervention included computerised reminders to test patients, an education package, payments for chlamydia testing, and feedback on testing rates. The primary outcome was chlamydia prevalence, estimated before randomisation (survey 1) and at the end of the trial (survey 2) in patients aged 16-29 years who attended the clinics. Analyses were done by intention to treat. General practitioners and clinic staff were aware of group allocation, whereas patients and laboratory staff who performed the chlamydia tests were not. This trial was completed on Dec 31, 2015, and is registered (ACTRN12610000297022). FINDINGS: Between Dec 14, 2010, and Sept 14, 2015, 26 clusters (63 clinics) received the chlamydia testing intervention and 26 (67 clinics) continued usual care. Over a mean duration of 3·1 years (SD 0·3), 93 828 young adults attended intervention clinics and 86 527 attended control clinics. The estimated chlamydia prevalence decreased from 5·0% (95% CI 3·8 to 6·2) at survey 1 to 3·4% (2·7 to 4·1) at survey 2 in the intervention clusters (difference -1·6%, 95% CI -2·9 to -0·3) and from 4·6% (95% CI 3·5 to 5·7) at survey 1 to 3·4% (2·4 to 4·5) at survey 2 in the control clusters (difference -1·1%, -2·7 to 0·5). The unadjusted odds ratio for the difference between intervention and control clusters was 0·9 (95% CI 0·5 to 1·5). INTERPRETATION: These findings, in conjunction with evidence about the feasibility of sustained uptake of opportunistic testing in primary care, indicate that sizeable reductions in chlamydia prevalence might not be achievable.

0,Genotype-Specific Concordance of Chlamydia trachomatis Genital Infection Within Heterosexual Partnerships,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000525,"BACKGROUND: Sexual transmission rates of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) cannot be measured directly; however, the study of concordance of Ct infection in sexual partnerships (dyads) can help to illuminate factors influencing Ct transmission. METHODS: Heterosexual men and women with Ct infection and their sex partners were enrolled and partner-specific coital and behavioral data collected for the prior 30 days. Microbiological data included Ct culture, and nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), quantitative Ct polymerase chain reaction, and ompA genotyping. We measured Ct concordance in dyads and factors (correlates) associated with concordance. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one women and 125 men formed 128 dyads. Overall, 72.9% of male partners of NAAT-positive women and 68.6% of female partners of NAAT-positive men were Ct-infected. Concordance was more common in dyads with culture-positive members (78.6% of male partners, 77% of female partners). Partners of women and men who were NAAT-positive only had lower concordance (33.3%, 46.4%, respectively). Women in concordant dyads had significantly higher median endocervical quantitative Ct polymerase chain reaction values (3,032) compared with CT-infected women in discordant dyads (1013 inclusion forming units DNA equivalents per mL; P < 0.01). Among 54 Ct-concordant dyads with ompA genotype data for both members, 96.2% had identical genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Higher organism load appears associated with concordance among women. Same-genotype chlamydial concordance was high in sexual partnerships. No behavioral factors were sufficiently discriminating to guide partner services activities. Findings may help model coitus-specific transmission probabilities."
0,Development a rapid and accurate multiplex real time PCR method for the detection Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis,10.1002/jcla.22126,"BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted diseases easily spread among sexually active people and often have no symptoms. Rapid and accurate method for detecting these infections are necessary in early stages. The traditional detection methods of them are difficult and time-consuming. METHODS: In this study, multiplex real time PCR was optimized for rapid identification of Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis in a single tube and was performed with our designed primers. The sensitivity test was carried out to designed primers with diluted genomic DNA. To defined the specificity, non STD bacteria were used as DNA template. RESULTS: This study indicated that the developed multiplex real time PCR can be an effective alternative procedure to the conventional methods for rapid and accurate identification of C Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis. Multiplex real-time PCR Results of them were checked with melting curves. The sensitivity of our designed primer by multiplex real time PCR for Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis were 4.78×1010 and 8.35×1010 , respectively, Which the primers did not amplify any product from a non-STD species. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex real time PCR by our new primers and analysis of melting curves were successfully usable for rapid and accurate detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis. This assay instead of traditional culture method, has considerable potential to be rapid, accurate and highly sensitive molecular diagnostic tool for simultaneous and direct detection."
1,"Self-Reported Infertility and Associated Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Among Women of Reproductive Age-National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, United States, 2013-2016",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000996,"BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility. We estimated the prevalence of infertility and infertility health care seeking. METHODS: We analyzed self-reported lifetime infertility and infertility health care-seeking in women aged 18 to 49 years in the 2013 and 2015 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Weighted prevalence of infertility and infertility health care seeking, prevalence ratios (PRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Among 2626 eligible women, 13.8% had self-reported infertility (95% CI, 12.3-15.3) with higher prevalence by age: 960, 18 to 29 years (PR, 6.4%; 95% CI, 4.8-8.0); 799, 30 to 39 years (PR, 14.8%; 95% CI, 12.2-17.3); and 867, 40 to 49 years (PR, 20.8%; 95% CI, 17.2-24.4). Non-Hispanic white women (PR, 15.4%; 95% CI, 13.0-17.8; n = 904) and non-Hispanic black women (PR, 12.9%; 95% CI, 10.3-15.5; n = 575) had the highest infertility prevalences. Women reporting PID treatment (n = 122) had higher infertility prevalence (PR, 24.2%; 95% CI, 16.2-32.2) than women without PID treatment (PR, 13.3%; 95% CI, 11.6-15.0; n = 2,485), especially among 18- to 29-year-old women (PR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.8-8.0). Of 327 women with infertility, 60.9% (95% CI, 56.1-65.8) sought health care. Women without health care insurance sought care less frequently than women with insurance. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative sample, 13.8% of reproductive-age women reported a history of infertility, of whom 40% did not access health care. Self-reported PID was associated with infertility, especially in young women. Annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screening to avert PID may reduce the burden of infertility in the United States."
0,[Sexually transmitted infections and male fertility],10.1007/s00105-018-4300-9,"BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are common worldwide and can cause impairment of fertility. In women pelvic inflammatory disease with subsequent tubal sterility is well-documented but the influence of STI on male fertility is still controversely discussed OBJECTIVE: The effects of various bacterial and viral STI on male fertility are discussed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An evaluation of the international literature up to 30 April 2018 was carried out including studies on larger collectives from the Asiatic region. RESULTS: There is still an inconsistent picture of the influence of various bacterial and viral STI on male fertility. Direct or indirect evidence of the impact of a pathogen alone on the quality of ejaculates could not be clearly demonstrated; however, there are indications of a negative effect by Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species in large Asiatic collectives. The transmission of viral pathogens, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) possible impairs the success of assisted reproductive techniques. In contrast, manifest inflammatory processes of the male genital tract caused by STI (in particular Chlamydia and gonococci) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections often result in impairment of sperm qualtity. CONCLUSION: In cases of male fertility disorders a microbiological clarification is recommended. Further studies on the effect of STI on male fertility in larger collectives are necessary, particularly for Caucasian populations. The utilization of existing preventive measures, such as screening for Chlamydia in young women and HPV vaccination also for young males, should be intensively promoted."
0,Increased susceptibility to vaginal simian/human immunodeficiency virus transmission in pig-tailed macaques coinfected with Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis,10.1093/infdis/jiu240,"BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are associated with an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but their biological effect on HIV susceptibility is not fully understood. METHODS: Female pig-tailed macaques inoculated with Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis (n = 9) or medium (controls; n = 7) were repeatedly challenged intravaginally with SHIVSF162p3. Virus levels were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction, plasma and genital cytokine levels by Luminex assays, and STI clinical signs by colposcopy. RESULTS: Simian/HIV (SHIV) susceptibility was enhanced in STI-positive macaques (P = .04, by the log-rank test; relative risk, 2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.6]). All STI-positive macaques were SHIV infected, whereas 3 controls (43%) remained uninfected. Moreover, relative to STI-negative animals, SHIV infections occurred earlier in the menstrual cycle in STI-positive macaques (P = .01, by the Wilcoxon test). Levels of inflammatory cytokines (interferon γ, interleukin 6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) were higher in STI-positive macaques during STI inoculation and SHIV exposure periods (P ≤ .05, by the Wilcoxon test). CONCLUSIONS: C. trachomatis and T. vaginalis infection increase the susceptibility to SHIV, likely because of prolonged genital tract inflammation. These novel data demonstrate a biological link between these nonulcerative STIs and the risk of SHIV infection, supporting epidemiological associations of HIV and STIs. This study establishes a macaque model for studies of high-risk HIV transmission and prevention."
0,Influence of sexually transmitted infections on the cervical cytological abnormalities among Iranian women: A cross-sectional study.,10.18502/ijrm.v21i6.13636,"BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are one of the world's most severe health challenges. The existence of STIs such as human papillomavirus  (HPV) might cause cervical cell changes leading to cervical cancer. OBJECTIVE:  This study aims to assess the association of STIs with cervical cytological  abnormalities and genital warts among women in northeastern Iran. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 190 women referred to the  central laboratory of Academic Center for Education, Culture, and Research,  Mashhad, Iran from March to July 2022. The presence of genital infections caused  by Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and  Herpes simplex viruses (1 and 2) were assessed using the real-time polymerase  chain reaction method. HPV genital infection was detected based on the principles  of reverse hybridization, and cellular changes in the cervix were examined by the  liquid-based cytology technique. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 35.33  ± 8.9 yr. 34 different HPV genotypes were detected in all HPV-positive cases, and  the most common genotype was low-risk HPV6. No significant association was found  between STIs and cervical cytology abnormalities. The prevalence rates of  sexually transmitted pathogens among HPV-positive and HPV-negative individuals  were 10.9 and 1.6%, respectively. The frequency of genital warts was  significantly higher in cases with multiple infections of high- and low-risk HPV  genotypes. CONCLUSION: High percentages of the participants with non-HPV STIs and  HPV infection had normal cervical cytology. It is advised to use STIs and HPV  diagnostic tests along with cytology examinations for cervical cancer screening."
0,Molecular epidemiology and socio-demographic risk factors of sexually transmitted infections among women in Lebanon,10.1186/s12879-020-05066-8,"BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) cause a major public health problem that affect both men and women in developing and developed countries. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of 11 STIs among women who voluntarily participated in the study, while seeking gynecological checkup. The existence of an association between the presence of pathogens and symptoms and various sociodemographic risk factors was assessed. METHODS: A total of 505 vaginal and cervical specimens were collected from women above 18 years of age, with or without symptoms related to gynecological infections. Nucleic acid was extracted and samples were tested by real-time PCR for the following pathogens: Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Urealplasma parvum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma girerdii, Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida albicans and Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Positive HPV samples underwent genotyping using a microarray system. RESULTS: Of the 505 samples, 312 (62%) were screened positive for at least one pathogen. Of these, 36% were positive for Gardnerella vaginalis, 35% for Ureaplasma parvum, 8% for Candida albicans, 6.7% for HPV, 4.6% for Ureaplasma urealyticum, 3.6% for Mycoplasma hominis, 2% for Trichomonas vaginalis, 0.8% for Chlamydia trachomatis, 0.4% for Mycoplasma girerdii, 0.2% for Mycoplasma genitalium and 0.2% for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Lack of symptoms was reported in 187 women (37%), among whom 61% were infected. Thirty-four samples were HPV positive, with 17 high risk HPV genotypes (HR-HPV); the highest rates being recorded for types 16 (38%), 18 (21%) and 51 (18%). Out of the 34 HPV positives, 29 participants had HR-HPV. Association with various risk factors were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that presents data about the presence of STIs among women in Lebanon and the MENA region by simultaneous detection of 11 pathogens. In the absence of systematic STI surveillance in Lebanon, concurrent screening for HPV and PAP smear is warranted."
0,A Web-Based Sexual Health Intervention to Prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections in Hong Kong: Model-Based Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,10.2196/45054,"BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a significant public health concern, particularly among young adults, and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)  infections are the most common STIs in young women. One of the most effective  ways to prevent STIs is the consistent use of condoms during sexual intercourse.  There has been no economic evaluation of the interactive web-based sexual health  program, Smart Girlfriend, within the Chinese population. OBJECTIVE: This study  aimed to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of Smart Girlfriend in  preventing STIs in the Chinese population. The evaluation compared the program  with a control intervention that used a 1-page information sheet on condom use.  METHODS: A decision-analytic model that included a decision tree followed by a  Markov structure of CT infections was developed since CT is the most prevalent  STI among young women. The model represents the long-term experience of  individuals who received either the intervention or the control. One-way and  probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. The main outcomes were the  number of CT infections and the incremental cost as per quality-adjusted life  year (QALY). RESULTS: A cohort of 10,000 sexually active nonpregnant young women  initially entered the model in a noninfectious state (ie, ""well""). In the  base-case analysis, the implementation of the Smart Girlfriend program resulted  in the prevention of 0.45% of CT infections, 0.3% of pelvic inflammatory disease,  and 0.04% of chronic pelvic pain, leading to a gain of 70 discounted QALYs and  cost savings over a 4-year time horizon, compared to the control group. With more  than 4548 users, the intervention would be cost-effective, and with more than  8315 users, the intervention would be cost saving. A 99% probability of being  cost-effective was detected with a willingness to pay US $17,409 per QALY.  CONCLUSIONS: Smart Girlfriend is a cost-effective and possibly cost-saving  program over a 4-year time horizon. This result was particularly sensitive to the  number of website users; launching the website would be cost-effective if more  than 4548 people used it. Further work is warranted to explore if the findings  could be expanded to apply to women who have sex with women and in the context of  other STIs.

0,STI-GMaS: an open-source environment for simulation of sexually-transmitted infections,10.1186/1752-0509-8-66,"BACKGROUND: Sexually-transmitted pathogens often have severe reproductive health implications if treatment is delayed or absent, especially in females. The complex processes of disease progression, namely replication and ascension of the infection through the genital tract, span both extracellular and intracellular physiological scales, and in females can vary over the distinct phases of the menstrual cycle. The complexity of these processes, coupled with the common impossibility of obtaining comprehensive and sequential clinical data from individual human patients, makes mathematical and computational modelling valuable tools in developing our understanding of the infection, with a view to identifying new interventions. While many within-host models of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) are available in existing literature, these models are difficult to deploy in clinical/experimental settings since simulations often require complex computational approaches. RESULTS: We present STI-GMaS (Sexually-Transmitted Infections - Graphical Modelling and Simulation), an environment for simulation of STI models, with a view to stimulating the uptake of these models within the laboratory or clinic. The software currently focuses upon the representative case-study of Chlamydia trachomatis, the most common sexually-transmitted bacterial pathogen of humans. Here, we demonstrate the use of a hybrid PDE-cellular automata model for simulation of a hypothetical Chlamydia vaccination, demonstrating the effect of a vaccine-induced antibody in preventing the infection from ascending to above the cervix. This example illustrates the ease with which existing models can be adapted to describe new studies, and its careful parameterisation within STI-GMaS facilitates future tuning to experimental data as they arise. CONCLUSIONS: STI-GMaS represents the first software designed explicitly for in-silico simulation of STI models by non-theoreticians, thus presenting a novel route to bridging the gap between computational and clinical/experimental disciplines. With the propensity for model reuse and extension, there is much scope within STI-GMaS to allow clinical and experimental studies to inform model inputs and drive future model development. Many of the modelling paradigms and software design principles deployed to date transfer readily to other STIs, both bacterial and viral; forthcoming releases of STI-GMaS will extend the software to incorporate a more diverse range of infections."
0,Co-infection of sexually transmitted pathogens and Human Papillomavirus in cervical samples of women of Brazil,10.1186/s12879-017-2835-5,"BACKGROUND: Some sexually transmitted infectious agents, such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Herpes simplex, cause local inflammation, and could contribute to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical lesion progression. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine any association between the presence of microorganisms of gynecological importance, sexual behavior, clinical and demographical variables to the development and progress of cervical lesions. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-two women between 14 and 78 years and living at Vitória da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil, were included (62 individuals with cervical lesions and 70 without lesions). They answered a questionnaire to provide data for a socioeconomic and sexual activity profile. Samples of cervical swabs were collected and analyzed by PCR to detect genital microorganisms and HPV. Quantitative PCR was used to detect and quantify Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum. Univariate and multiple logistic regression were performed to measure the association with the cervical lesions, and an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. The Mann-Whitney U test was also used to compare the microorganism load in the case and control groups. The significance level was 5% in all hypotheses tested. RESULTS: Cervical lesions were associated with: women in a stable sexual relationship (OR = 14.21, 95%CI = 3.67-55.018), positive PCR for HPV (OR = 16.81, 95%CI = 4.19-67.42), Trichomonas vaginalis (OR = 8.566, 95%CI = 2.04-35.94) and Gardnerella vaginalis (OR = 6.13, 95%CI = 1.53-24.61), adjusted by age and qPCR for U. parvum. U. parvum load showed a statistical difference between the case and control groups (p-value = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Variables such as stable relationship, HPV, T. vaginalis, G. vaginalis were associated with cervical lesions in epidemiological studies. U. parvum load was higher in woman with cervical lesions compared with women without lesions. Additional studies are needed to better understand the role of these factors in cervical lesion development."
0,"Association between genital mycoplasmas infection and human papillomavirus infection, abnormal cervical cytopathology, and cervical cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis",10.1007/s00404-018-4733-5,"BACKGROUND: Some studies demonstrated that female genital mycoplasmas play important roles in human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, abnormal cervical cytopathology, and cervical cancer. However, those results remained inconclusive. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between female genital mycoplasmas and those disorders. METHODS: Computerized databases were comprehensively searched before 26 January 2017. Pooled odd radios (ORs) and correlative 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adopted to evaluate the strength of association. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis included 22 studies with 16,181 participants. Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum were associated with a significantly increased risk of overall HPV infection (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.05-2.34; OR 3.02, 95% CI 2.10-4.33, respectively), and U. urealyticum and Mycoplasma genitalium were associated with a significantly increased risk of high-risk HPV infection (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.05-1.80; OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.11-2.02, respectively). In addition, U. urealyticum, U. parvum, and Mycoplasma hominis were associated with a significantly increased risk of abnormal cervical cytopathology (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.23-1.85; OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.10-1.80; OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.10-1.99, respectively). CONCLUSION: We found that U. urealyticum and M. genitalium may increase the risk of high-risk HPV infection, while U. urealyticum, U. parvum, and M. hominis may increase the risk of abnormal cervical cytopathology."
0,[Chlamydia mimics suspected ovarian cancer in a 21-year-old patient],,"BACKGROUND: The antigen CA125 is mainly known as a tumour marker in ovarian cancer, but may also be elevated in benign gynaecological disorders and non-gynaecological diseases. CASE DESCRIPTION: We examined a 21-year-old patient in the gynaecological oncology outpatient clinic, after she was referred with abnormal ovaries on ultrasound and a significantly elevated CA125. The patient had seen a gynaecologist four weeks earlier because of persistent abdominal pain, deep dyspareunia and vaginal bleeding after insertion of a Mirena IUD that has since been removed. The IUD turned out to be placed in the presence of an undiagnosed STD (Chlamydia), which seems to explain the abnormal ovaries and elevated tumour marker due to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). CONCLUSION: PID can present atypically resembling ovarian carcinoma. Before inserting an IUD, evaluation of sexual history is essential to estimate the risk of an STI and, if necessary, to perform diagnostics."
1,"Heterogeneity in risk of pelvic inflammatory diseases after chlamydia infection: a population-based study in Manitoba, Canada",10.1093/infdis/jiu483,"BACKGROUND: The association between chlamydia infection and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a key parameter for models evaluating the impact of chlamydia control programs. We quantified this association using a retrospective population-based cohort. METHODS: We used administrative health data sets to construct a retrospective population-based cohort of women and girls aged 12-24 years who were resident in Manitoba, Canada, between 1992 and 1996. We performed survival analysis on a subcohort of individuals who were tested for chlamydia to estimate the risk of PID diagnosed in a primary care, outpatient, or inpatient setting after ≥ 1 positive chlamydia test. RESULTS: A total of 73 883 individuals contributed 625 621 person years of follow-up. Those with a diagnosis of chlamydia had an increased risk of PID over their reproductive lifetime compared with those who tested negative (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-1.70). This risk increased with each subsequent infection: the AHR was 1.17 for first reinfection (95% CI, 1.06-1.30) and 1.35 for the second (95% CI, 1.04-1.75). The increased risk of PID from reinfection was highest in younger individuals (AHR, 4.55 (95% CI, 3.59-5.78) in individuals aged 12-15 years at the time of their second reinfection, compared with individuals older than 30 years). CONCLUSIONS: There is heterogeneity in the risk of PID after a chlamydia infection. Describing the progression to PID in mathematical models as an average rate may be an oversimplification; more accurate estimates of the cost-effectiveness of screening may be obtained by using an individual-based measure of risk. Health inequalities may be reduced by targeting health promotion interventions at sexually active girls younger than 16 years and those with a history of chlamydia."
0,Evaluation of human papillomavirus DNA detection in samples obtained for routine Chlamydia trachomatis screening,10.1016/j.jcv.2015.01.008,"BACKGROUND: The costs and logistics involved in obtaining samples is a bottleneck in large-scale studies of the circulation of human papillomavirus (HPV), which are useful for monitoring and optimisation of HPV-vaccination programs. Residual samples obtained after screening for Chlamydia trachomatis could constitute a convenient, low-cost solution. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated HPV DNA detection and typing using (i) the residual samples routinely taken for C. trachomatis screening or (ii) the sample types used in large-scale phase III HPV vaccination trials (cervical, vulvar, labial, perineal, perianal, scrotal and penile shaft samples). STUDY DESIGN: Samples from 127 men and 110 women attending two sexual health clinics were analysed using PCR for HPV DNA, with typing using mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The HPV DNA prevalence was 7.1% in male urine samples, but 57.3% in female urine/vaginal samples, which was even higher than the HPV prevalence found in cervical samples (54.1%). The sensitivity for HPV DNA detection in the urine/vaginal samples was 7.9% (95% CI 3.0-16.4) for men and 78.9% (95% CI 67.6-87.7) for women, using detection in any one of the reference samples as reference. With cervical samples as reference, the sensitivity was 89.3 % (95% CI 78.1-95.9). CONCLUSIONS: Among men, low sensitivity of urine for HPV detection suggests limited usefulness. Among women, the high sensitivity of urine/vaginal samples for HPV detection suggests a useful low-cost solution for the study of HPV epidemiology."
0,Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome in adolescent and young adult females: Utility of a decision rule,10.1016/j.ajem.2021.07.053,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHC) is often missed or delayed in patients with right upper quadrant pain (RUQ). OBJECTIVE: To develop a decision rule that predicts FHC in females with RUQ pain based on a constellation of historical features, physical examination findings and laboratory results. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study to test the utility of our FHC decision rule in sexually active females, aged 13-20 years, with RUQ pain who were seen in an urban ED over 57 months. The decision rule was based on 4 features: 1. Presence of pleuritic chest pain, 2. Tenderness over the anterior border of liver, 3. History of worsening pain on R lateral position and 4. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate > 30 mm/h. The rule was considered positive if all 4 features were present. FHC was diagnosed in patients with RUQ pain and a positive GEN-PROBE Aptima Combo Assay for either gonorrhea or chlamydia on urine or endocervical specimens. RESULTS: 130 patients were enrolled. 24 were excluded, leaving 106 (81.5%) for analysis. 34/106 (32%) had STI/FHC. There were no differences in mean age or sexual characteristics between those with and without STI/FHC. A positive FHC decision rule had a positive predictive value of 75% (95%CI: 46.8%-91.1%) based on 96 cases for whom all features were available for analysis. CONCLUSION: Our decision rule shows promise in allowing for the early identification of FHC in adolescent and young adult females. Additional study is needed to corroborate these findings and test its generalizability."
0,Endometrial responses to bacterial and viral infection: a scoping review.,10.1093/humupd/dmad013,"BACKGROUND: The endometrium is a highly dynamic tissue that undergoes dramatic proliferation and differentiation monthly in order to prepare the uterus for  implantation and pregnancy. Intrauterine infection and inflammation are being  increasingly recognized as potential causes of implantation failure and  miscarriage, as well as obstetric complications later in gestation. However, the  mechanisms by which the cells of the endometrium respond to infection remain  understudied and recent progress is slowed in part owing to similar overlapping  studies being performed in different species. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of  this scoping review is to systematically summarize all published studies in  humans and laboratory animals that have investigated the innate immune sensing  and response of the endometrium to bacteria and viruses, and the signaling  mechanisms involved. This will enable gaps in our knowledge to be identified to  inform future studies. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Ovid Embase/Medline,  PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases were searched using  a combination of controlled and free text terms for uterus/endometrium,  infections, and fertility to March 2022. All primary research papers that have  reported on endometrial responses to bacterial and viral infections in the  context of reproduction were included. To focus the scope of the current review,  studies in domesticated animals, included bovine, porcine, caprine, feline, and  canine species were excluded. OUTCOMES: This search identified 42 728 studies for  screening and 766 full-text studies were assessed for eligibility. Data was  extracted from 76 studies. The majority of studies focused on endometrial  responses to Escherichia coli and Chlamydia trachomatis, with some studies of  Neisseria gonorrhea, Staphylococcus aureus, and the Streptococcus family.  Endometrial responses have only been studied in response to three groups of  viruses thus far: HIV, Zika virus, and the herpesvirus family. For most  infections, both cellular and animal models have been utilized in vitro and in  vivo, focusing on endometrial production of cytokines, chemokines, and  antiviral/antimicrobial factors, and the expression of innate immune signaling  pathway mediators after infection. This review has identified gaps for future  research in the field as well as highlighted some recent developments in organoid  systems and immune cell co-cultures that offer new avenues for studying  endometrial responses to infection in more physiologically relevant models that  could accelerate future findings in this area. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: This scoping  review provides an overarching summary and benchmark of the current state of  research on endometrial innate immune responses to bacterial and viral infection.  This review also highlights some exciting recent developments that enable future  studies to be designed to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms utilized by  the endometrium to respond to infection and their downstream effects on uterine  function."
0,High prevalence of sexual infection by human papillomavirus and Chlamydia trachomatis in sexually-active women from a large city in the Amazon region of Brazil,10.1371/journal.pone.0270874,"BACKGROUND: The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Chlamydia trachomatis are the most prevalent Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) worldwide, and are associated cervical cancer and pelvic inflammatory disease, respectively. However, 80% of women testing positive are asymptomatic. In the Amazon region, young women, in particular, are widely exposed to the infections and their consequences. OBJECTIVES: Determine the prevalence of sexual infection by HPV and C. trachomatis in young, sexually-active women treated at a university health program in a large city of the Brazilian Amazon region. METHODS: We amplified the L1 gene of HPV. We amplified ompA gene of C. trachomatis by nested PCR, and the study participants filled in a questionnaire on their social, epidemiological, and reproductive health characteristics. The data were analyzed using the Odds Ratio, to evaluate the degree of association of these variables with the observed infections. RESULTS: The prevalence of infection by HPV was 15.5% (47/303). This infection was recorded in 32.2% of the women of less than 25 years of age (OR:3.02 [CI95%] = 1.32-6.92; p = 0.014), 17.9% of the single women (OR: 2.41 [CI95%] = 1.22-4.75; p = 0.014), 23.8% of the women that reported having first sexual intercourse at less than 15 years of age (OR: 2.22 [CI95%] = 1.16-4.23; p = 0.021), 20% of those that reported having had more than one sexual partner during their lifetime (OR: 3.83 [CI95%] = 1.56-9.37; p = 0.003), and in 28.3% that use oral contraceptives (CI95% = 1.33-5.43; p = 0.008). The prevalence of sexual infection by C. trachomatis was 4.6% (14/303), and this bacterium was present in 16.1% of the young women of less than 25 years of age (OR: 2.86 [CI95%] = 1.33-5.43; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of HPV in young, unmarried women who started their sex lives early, who had several sexual partners in their lives and who used oral contraceptives. The prevalence of C. trachomatis was high only in young women. Our data are in accordance with other studies in Brazil and in the world and may serve to base the formulation of diagnostic and screening measures for these infections in women in the Amazon."
1,Comparison of the population excess fraction of Chlamydia trachomatis infection on pelvic inflammatory disease at 12-months in the presence and absence of chlamydia testing and treatment: Systematic review and retrospective cohort analysis,10.1371/journal.pone.0171551,"BACKGROUND: The impact of Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) control on the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is theoretically limited by the proportion of PID caused by chlamydia. We estimate the population excess fraction (PEF) of treated chlamydia infection on PID at 12-months in settings with widespread chlamydia control (testing and treatment) and compare this to the estimated PEF of untreated chlamydia. METHODS: We used two large retrospective population-based cohorts of women of reproductive age from settings with widespread chlamydia control to calculate the PEF of treated chlamydia on PID at 12-months. We undertook a systematic review to identify further studies that reported the risk of PID in women who were tested for chlamydia (infected and uninfected). We used the same method to calculate the PEF in eligible studies then compared all estimates of PEF. RESULTS: The systematic review identified a single study, a randomised controlled trial of chlamydia screening (POPI-RCT). In the presence of testing and treatment <10% of PID at 12-months was attributable to treated (baseline) chlamydia infections (Manitoba: 8.86%(95%CI 7.15-10.75); Denmark: 3.84%(3.26-4.45); screened-arm POPI-RCT: 0.99%(0.00-29.06)). In the absence of active chlamydia treatment 26.44%(11.57-46.32) of PID at 12-months was attributable to untreated (baseline) chlamydia infections (deferred-arm POPI-RCT). The PEFs suggest that eradicating baseline chlamydia infections could prevent 484 cases of PID at 12-months per 100,000 women in the untreated setting and 13-184 cases of PID per 100,000 tested women in the presence of testing and treatment. CONCLUSION: Testing and treating chlamydia reduced the PEF of chlamydia on PID by 65% compared to the untreated setting. But in the presence of testing and treatment over 90% of PID could not be attributed to a baseline chlamydia infection. More information is needed about the aetiology of PID to develop effective strategies for improving the reproductive health of women."
0,Self-Collected versus Clinician-Collected Sampling for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Screening: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis,10.1371/journal.pone.0132776,"BACKGROUND: The increases in STI rates since the late 1990s in Canada have occurred despite widespread primary care and targeted public health programs and in the setting of universal health care. More innovative interventions are required that would eliminate barriers to STI testing such as internet-based or mail-in home and community service testing for patients that are hard to reach, who refuse to go for clinician-based testing, or who decline an examination. Jurisdictions such as New Zealand and some American states currently use self-collected sampling, but without the required evidence to determine whether self-collected specimens are as accurate as clinician-collected specimens in terms of chlamydia and gonorrhea diagnostic accuracy. The objective of the review is to compare self-collected vaginal, urine, pharyngeal and rectal samples to our reference standard - clinician-collected cervical, urethral, pharyngeal and rectal sampling techniques to identify a positive specimen using nucleic acid amplification test assays. METHODS: The hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic and the fixed effect models were used to assess the accuracy of comparable specimens that were collected by patients compared to clinicians. Sensitivity and specificity estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported as our main outcome measures. FINDINGS: We included 21 studies based on over 6100 paired samples. Fourteen included studies examined chlamydia only, 6 compared both gonorrhea and chlamydia separately in the same study, and one examined gonorrhea. The six chlamydia studies comparing self-collection by vaginal swab to a clinician-collected cervical swab had the highest sensitivity (92%, 95% CI 87-95) and specificity (98%, 95% CI 97-99), compared to other specimen-types (urine/urethra or urine/cervix). Six studies compared urine self-samples to urethra clinician-collected samples in males and produced a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI 83-93) and a specificity of 99% (95% CI 0.94-0.99). Taking into account that urine samples may be less sensitive than cervical samples, eight chlamydia studies that compared urine self-collected verses clinician-collected cervical samples had a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 81-91) and high specificity of 99% (95% CI 0.98-1.00). For gonorrhea testing, self-collected urine samples compared to clinician-collected urethra samples in males produced a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 83-97) and specificity of 99% (95% CI 0.98-1.00). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity of vaginal self-collected swabs compared to swabs collected by clinicians supports the use of vaginal swab as the recommended specimen of choice in home-based screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Urine samples for gonorrhea collected by men had comparably high sensitivity and specificity, so could be recommended as they can be left at room temperature for several days, allowing for the possibility of mail-in home-based testing. In populations that may not go for testing at all, do not have the option of clinical testing, or who refuse a clinical examination, self-collected screening would be a good alternative. We recommend that guidelines on how to self-collect gonorrhea and chlamydia urine, vaginal, rectal and pharyngeal specimens be published."
0,The impact of hormonal contraception and pregnancy on sexually transmitted infections and on cervicovaginal microbiota in african sex workers,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000245,"BACKGROUND: The observed association between Depo-Provera injectable use and increased HIV acquisition may be caused by hormone-induced increased susceptibility to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or changes in the cervicovaginal microbiota (VMB), accompanied by genital immune activation and/or mucosal remodeling. METHODS: Rwandan female sex workers (n = 800) were interviewed about contraceptive use and sexual behavior and were tested for STIs, bacterial vaginosis by Nugent score and pregnancy, at baseline. A subset of 397 HIV-negative, nonpregnant women were interviewed and tested again at regular intervals for 2 years. The VMB of a subset of 174 women was characterized by phylogenetic microarray. Outcomes of STI and VMB were compared between women with hormonal exposures (reporting oral contraceptive or injectable use, or testing positive for pregnancy) and controls (not reporting hormonal contraception and not pregnant). RESULTS: Oral contraceptive use was associated with increased human papillomavirus prevalence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.10; 1.21-7.94) and Chlamydia trachomatis incidence (aOR, 6.13; 1.58-23.80), injectable use with increased herpes simplex virus-2 prevalence (aOR, 2.13; 1.26-3.59) and pregnancy with lower HIV prevalence (aOR, 0.45; 0.22-0.92) but higher candidiasis incidence (aOR, 2.14; 1.12-4.09). Hormonal status was not associated with Nugent score category or phylogenetic VMB clustering, but oral contraceptive users had lower semiquantitative vaginal abundance of Prevotella, Sneathia/Leptotrichia amnionii, and Mycoplasma species. CONCLUSIONS: Oral contraceptive and injectable use were associated with several STIs but not with VMB composition. The increased herpes simplex virus-2 prevalence among injectable users might explain the potentially higher HIV risk in these women, but more research is needed to confirm these results and elucidate biological mechanisms."
0,Analysis of the microbiota composition in the genital tract of infertile patients with chronic endometritis or endometrial polyps.,10.3389/fcimb.2023.1125640,"BACKGROUND: The previous researches show that infertile patients have a higher incidence of endometritis and endometrial polyps, and the occurrence of these two  diseases is related to changes in the microbiota of the genital tract. We aim to  determine the composition and changing characteristics of the microbiota in the  genital tract (especially the endometrium) of infertile patients with chronic  endometritis or endometrial polyps, and find the correlation between it and the  occurrence of diseases. METHODS: This is a prospective study. We collected  genital tract biopsy samples from 134 asymptomatic infertile patients receiving  assisted reproductive therapy before embryo transfer. Through pathological  examination and 16S ribosomal RNA(16S rRNA) sequencing, we determined the  distribution of chronic endometritis and endometrial polyps in these patients, as  well as their distribution of reproductive tract microorganisms. RESULTS:  Compared with the normal control group, the microbial group of reproductive tract  in patients with chronic endometritis and endometrial polyps is changed, and  there are significant species differences and relative abundance differences in  the vagina, cervix and uterine cavity. Lactobacillus, the dominant flora of  female genital tract, showed a change in abundance in patients with endometrial  diseases. Endometrial microbiota composed of Staphylococcus, Gardnerella,  Atopobium, Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Chlamydia, Fusobacterium,  Acinetobacter, etc. are related to chronic endometritis and endometrial polyps.  CONCLUSION: The results showed that, compared with the normal control group, the  endometrial microbiota of infertile patients with chronic endometritis or  endometrial polyps did have significant changes in the relative abundance  distribution of species, suggesting that changes in local microecology may be an  important factor in the occurrence of disease, or even adverse pregnancy  outcomes. The further study of endometrial microecology may provide a new  opportunity to further improve the diagnosis and treatment strategy of chronic  endometritis."
0,"The Estimated Lifetime Medical Cost of Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Trichomoniasis in the United States, 2018",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001357,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to provide updated estimates of the average lifetime medical cost per infection for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis. METHODS: We adapted a published decision tree model that allowed for 7 possible outcomes of infection: (1) symptomatic infection, treated, no sequelae; (2) symptomatic infection, not treated, sequelae; (3) symptomatic infection, not treated, no sequelae; (4) asymptomatic infection, treated, sequelae; (5) asymptomatic infection, treated, no sequelae; (6) asymptomatic infection, not treated, sequelae; and (7) asymptomatic infection, not treated, no sequelae. The base case values and ranges we applied for the model inputs (i.e., the probability and cost assumptions) were based on published studies. RESULTS: The estimated lifetime medical costs per infection for men and women, respectively, were $46 (95% credibility interval, $32-$62) and $262 ($127-$483) for chlamydia, $78 ($36-$145) and $254 ($96-$518) for gonorrhea, and $5 ($1-$14) and $36 ($17-$58) for trichomoniasis. Cost estimates for men were most sensitive to assumptions regarding the probability that the infection is symptomatic, the probability of treatment if asymptomatic, and the cost of treatment of infection. Cost estimates for chlamydia and gonorrhea in women were most sensitive to assumptions regarding the probability and cost of subsequent pelvic inflammatory disease. CONCLUSIONS: These estimates of the lifetime medical cost per infection can inform updated estimates of the total annual cost of sexually transmitted infections in the United States, as well as analyses of the value and cost-effectiveness of sexually transmitted infection prevention interventions."
0,Sample size considerations using mathematical models: an example with Chlamydia trachomatis infection and its sequelae pelvic inflammatory disease,10.1186/s12879-015-0953-5,"BACKGROUND: The success of an intervention to prevent the complications of an infection is influenced by the natural history of the infection. Assumptions about the temporal relationship between infection and the development of sequelae can affect the predicted effect size of an intervention and the sample size calculation. This study investigates how a mathematical model can be used to inform sample size calculations for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) using the example of Chlamydia trachomatis infection and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). METHODS: We used a compartmental model to imitate the structure of a published RCT. We considered three different processes for the timing of PID development, in relation to the initial C. trachomatis infection: immediate, constant throughout, or at the end of the infectious period. For each process we assumed that, of all women infected, the same fraction would develop PID in the absence of an intervention. We examined two sets of assumptions used to calculate the sample size in a published RCT that investigated the effect of chlamydia screening on PID incidence. We also investigated the influence of the natural history parameters of chlamydia on the required sample size. RESULTS: The assumed event rates and effect sizes used for the sample size calculation implicitly determined the temporal relationship between chlamydia infection and PID in the model. Even small changes in the assumed PID incidence and relative risk (RR) led to considerable differences in the hypothesised mechanism of PID development. The RR and the sample size needed per group also depend on the natural history parameters of chlamydia. CONCLUSIONS: Mathematical modelling helps to understand the temporal relationship between an infection and its sequelae and can show how uncertainties about natural history parameters affect sample size calculations when planning a RCT."
1,What is the effectiveness of community-based health promotion campaigns on chlamydia screening uptake in young people and what barriers and facilitators have been identified? A mixed-methods systematic review,10.1136/sextrans-2021-055142,"BACKGROUND: The UK National Chlamydia Screening Programme uses an opportunistic approach. Many programmes use campaigns to raise awareness of chlamydia screening in young people. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of campaigns on uptake of chlamydia screening in young people. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review of articles assessing the outcomes of community-based health-promotion campaigns to increase chlamydia screening in young people, their experiences of the campaigns and other facilitators and barriers to the conduct of the campaigns. We searched four databases for quantitative and qualitative studies with no language restrictions. MAIN RESULTS: From 10 329 records identified, 19 studies (20 articles) were included in the review: 14 quantitative, 2 qualitative and 3 mixed methods. All studies with quantitative outcomes were before-after study designs or interrupted time series. The prediction interval for relative change (RC) in test counts ranged from 0.95 to 1.56, with a summary pooled estimate of RC 1.22 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.30, 13 studies, I2=97%). For test positivity rate, 95% prediction interval was 0.59 to 1.48, with a summary pooled estimate of RC 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07, 8 studies, I2=91.8%). Large variation in characteristics between studies precluded exploring outcomes by type of campaign components. Seven major qualitative themes to improve screening were identified: targeting of campaigns; quality of materials and message; language; anonymity; use of technology; relevance; and variety of testing options. CONCLUSIONS: Health promotion campaigns aiming to increase chlamydia testing in those aged 15-24 years may show some effectiveness in increasing overall numbers of tests, however numbers of positive tests do not follow the same trend. Qualitative findings indicate that campaigns require clear, relevant messaging that displays the full range of testing options and assures anonymity in order to be effective."
1,"The vaginal microbiota and its association with human papillomavirus, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis",10.1016/j.cmi.2018.04.019,"BACKGROUND: The vaginal microbiota may modulate susceptibility to human papillomavirus (HPV), Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium infections. Persistent infection with a carcinogenic HPV is a prerequisite for cervical cancer, and C. trachomatis, N. gonorrheae and M. genitalium genital infections are all associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and subsequent infertility issues. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between these infections and the vaginal microbiota. DATA SOURCES: The search was conducted on Medline and the Web of Science for articles published between 2000 and 2016. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria included a measure of association for vaginal microbiota and one of the considered STIs, female population, cohort, cross-sectional and interventional designs, and the use of PCR methods for pathogen detection. METHODS: The vaginal microbiota was dichotomized into high-Lactobacillus vaginal microbiota (HL-VMB) and low-Lactobacillus vaginal microbiota (LL-VMB), using either Nugent score, Amsel's criteria, presence of clue cells or gene sequencing. A random effects model assuming heterogeneity among the studies was used for each STI considered. RESULTS: The search yielded 1054 articles, of which 39 met the inclusion criteria. Measures of association with LL-VMB ranged from 0.6 (95% CI 0.3-1.2) to 2.8 (95% CI 0.3-28.0), 0.7 (95% CI 0.4-1.2) to 5.2 (95% CI 1.9-14.8), 0.8 (95% CI 0.5-1.4) to 3.8 (95% CI 0.4-36.2) and 0.4 (95% CI 0.1-1.5) to 6.1 (95% CI 2.0-18.5) for HPV, C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium infections, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although no clear trend for N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium infections could be detected, our results support a protective role of HL-VMB for HPV and C. trachomatis. Overall, these findings advocate for the use of high-resolution characterization methods for the vaginal microbiota and the need for longitudinal studies to lay the foundation for its integration in prevention and treatment strategies."
0,"Antimicrobial resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Germany: low levels of cephalosporin resistance, but high azithromycin resistance",10.1186/s12879-018-2944-9,"BACKGROUND: The widespread antimicrobial resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a serious problem for the treatment and control of gonorrhoea. Many of the previously effective therapeutic agents are no longer viable. Because N. gonorrhoeae infections are not reportable in Germany, only limited data on disease epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are available. The Gonococcal Resistance Network (GORENET) is a surveillance project to monitor trends in the antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae in Germany in order to guide treatment algorithms and target future prevention strategies. METHODS: Between April 2014 and December 2015, data on patient-related information were collected from laboratories nationwide, and susceptibility testing was performed on 537 N. gonorrhoeae isolates forwarded from the network laboratories to the Conciliar Laboratory for gonococci. Susceptibility results for cefixime, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and penicillin were defined according to EUCAST 4.0 standards. Percentages, medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated. RESULTS: Altogether, 90% of isolates were from men. The median age was 32 (IQR 25-44) years for men and 25 (IQR 22-40) years for women (p-value < 0.001). The most frequently tested materials among men were urethral (96.1%) and rectal swabs (1.7%), and among women, it was mainly endocervical and vaginal swabs (84.3%). None of the isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone. Furthermore, 1.9% (in 2014) and 1.4% (in 2015) of the isolates were resistant to cefixime, 11.9% and 9.8% showed resistance against azithromycin, 72.0% and 58.3% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 29.1% and 18.8% were resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to ceftriaxone was not detected, and the percentage of isolates with resistance to cefixime was low, whereas azithromycin resistance showed high levels during the observation period. The rates of ciprofloxacin resistance and penicillin resistance were very high across Germany. Continued surveillance of antimicrobial drug susceptibilities for N. gonorrhoeae remains highly important to ensure efficient disease management."
0,"Chronic intermittent abdominal pain in young woman with intestinal malrotation, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome and appendiceal neuroendocrine tumor: a rare case report and literature review",10.1186/s12905-015-0274-2,"BACKGROUND: There are a lot of different causes of abdominal pain; in this case, a young woman suffers from three diseases with similar symptoms. Adult intestinal mal-rotation is a rare condition of deviation from the normal 270° counter clockwise rotation of the midgut resulting in, not only mal-position of the small intestine, but also mal-fixation of the mesentery. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a rare complication of pelvic inflammatory disease; it involves liver capsule inflammation associated with genital tract infection, which is usually caused by Neisseria gonorrhoea and Chlamydia trachomatis. Neuroendocrine tumors are enterochromaffin cell neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems; the appendicular one is the most common primary malignant lesion of these tumors, it's incidence is about 0.3 - 0.9% of appendectomies done. Just for knowledge, this is the first described case of concomitant presence of all these diseases with clinical symptoms attributable to each one. CASE PRESENTATION: 40-years-old woman suffers from acute abdominal pain, predominantly on the right quadrants, without abdominal distension, no guarding nor rigidity and normal intestinal peristalsis. She has a long history of abdominal intermittent pain, with cramps every 30-40 min, resolving spontaneously. She was diagnosed as intestinal mal-rotation through computed tomography scan which has evidenced a mobilized intra--peritoneal duodenum with cecum/ascending colon predominately lying on the left side and the small intestine almost entirely lying on the right side of abdomen, without evidence of effusion, edema or signs of intestinal ischemia or infarction. Exploratory laparoscopy demonstrated an inflammatory process in the hepatic-renal space, with bloody adhesions above the liver capsule; this is additional to the typical pelvic inflammatory disease signs (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome). Appendectomy was performed with histological analysis resulting in appendicular neuroendocrine tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Although the patient has an intestinal mal-rotation which could explain the abdominal painful symptoms, it is not possible to exclude other concomitant causes, such as perihepatitis on pelvic inflammatory disease or neuroendocrine tumors. Even if all these diseases are rarely seen in daily clinical practice, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic intermittent abdominal pain in a young woman."
1,"Risk of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease in Relation to Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Testing, Repeat Testing, and Positivity: A Population-Based Cohort Study",10.1093/cid/cix769,"BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty around whether the risks of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) differ following Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea) infection. We quantified the risk of PID associated with chlamydia and gonorrhea infection and subsequent repeat infections in a whole-population cohort. METHODS: A cohort of 315123 Western Australian women, born during 1974-1995, was probabilistically linked to chlamydia and gonorrhea testing records and to hospitalizations and emergency department presentations for PID from 2002 to 2013. Time-updated survival analysis was used to investigate the association between chlamydia and gonorrhea testing, and positivity, and risk of PID. RESULTS: Over 3199135 person-years, 120748 women had pathology test records for both chlamydia and gonorrhea, 10745 chlamydia only, and 653 gonorrhea only. Among those tested, 16778 (12.8%) had ≥1 positive chlamydia test, 3195 (2.6%) ≥1 positive gonorrhea test, and 1874 (1.6%) were positive for both. There were 4819 PID presentations (2222 hospitalizations, 2597 emergency presentations). Adjusting for age, Aboriginality, year of follow-up, health area, and socioeconomic status, compared to women negative for chlamydia and gonorrhea, the relative risk (adjusted incidence rate ratio) of PID was 4.29 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.66-5.03) in women who were both chlamydia and gonorrhea positive; 4.54 (95% CI, 3.87-5.33) in those only gonorrhea positive; and 1.77 (95% CI, 1.61-1.94) in those only chlamydia positive. CONCLUSIONS: Gonorrhea infection conferred a substantially higher risk than chlamydia of hospitalization or emergency department presentation for PID. The emergence of gonorrhea antimicrobial resistance may have a serious impact on rates of PID and its associated reproductive health sequelae."
0,Granulomatous Peritonitis secondary to Chlamydia Trachomatis: A case report,10.1016/j.gore.2020.100558,"BACKGROUND: This case provides a rare case of Chlamydia Trachomatis presenting with ascites and granulomatous peritonitis. CASE: A 23-year old gravida 0 presented as a new patient to her gynecologist with complaints of irregular menses. A pelvic ultrasound showed ascites and the ovaries appeared heterogenous with irregular borders. A CA125 was 432. The patient was taken to the operating room by gynecologic oncology for a diagnostic laparoscopy. Biopsies were taken and final pathology resulted as ""diffuse granulomatous inflammation."" Post-operatively, the etiology remained unknown. The patient was brought back to the office for more testing. She tested positive for Chlamydia and was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease. CONCLUSION: When encountering granulomatous pathology, Chlamydia Trachomatis is a rare etiology however it should be included on the differential diagnosis."
0,"Prospective Evaluation of Cervicovaginal Self- and Cervical Physician Collection for the Detection of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Mycoplasma genitalium Infections",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000778,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the agreement between sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening using self-collected specimens and physician-collected specimens, and to investigate the acceptability of self-collection for screening in an 18-month study of female sex workers in a high-risk, low-resource setting. METHODS: A total of 350 female sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya, participated in a prospective study from 2009 to 2011. Women self-collected a cervicovaginal specimen. Next, a physician conducted a pelvic examination to obtain a cervical specimen. Physician- and self-collected specimens were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) using Aptima nucleic acid amplification assays (Hologic). Specimens were collected at 3-month intervals over 18-month follow-up. κ Statistics measured agreement of positivity between self-collection and physician collection. RESULTS: Baseline STI prevalence was 2.9% for N. gonorrhoeae, 5.2% for C. trachomatis, 9.2% for T. vaginalis, and 20.1% for MG in self-collected samples, and 2.3%, 3.7%, 7.2%, and 12.9%, respectively, in physician-collected samples. κ Agreement was consistently strong (range, 0.66-1.00) for all STIs over the 18-month study period, except for MG, which had moderate agreement (range, 0.50-0.75). Most participants found self-collection easy (94%) and comfortable (89%) at baseline, with responses becoming modestly more favorable over time. CONCLUSIONS: Self-collected specimen screening results showed strong agreement to clinical-collected specimens, except for MG, which was consistently detected more commonly in self-collected than in physician-collected specimens. Acceptability of the self-collection procedure was high at baseline and increased modestly over time. In high-risk, low-resource settings, STI screening with self-collected specimens provides a reliable and acceptable alternative to screening with physician-collected specimens."
0,Torsion of a hydrosalpinx in a virgin patient with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome: report of a rare condition and its possible etiology,10.1016/j.jpag.2012.11.006,"BACKGROUND: To describe a rare case of hydrosalpinx torsion in a virgin patient with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. CASE: A 25-year-old woman with previously diagnosed MRKH syndrome in whom lower abdominal pain led to discovery and resection of a hydosalpinx of unusual origin in a university hospital department of obstetrics and gynecology, Japan. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy revealed a twisted left-sided hydrosalpinx, and the mass was resected laparoscopically. Results of the blood test for Chlamydia trachomatis were positive, but results of the PCR test were negative. Our case was unusual in that hydrosalpinx is rare in virgin patients with MRKH. The cause of the hydrosalpinx was unclear, but one possibility is excess tubal secretions from the fallopian tube."
0,"Should Female Partners of Men With Non-Gonococcal Urethritis, Negative for Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, Be Informed and Treated? Clinical Outcomes From a Partner Study of Heterosexual Men With NGU",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000546,"BACKGROUND: To determine if female partners of men with pathogen-negative non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) are at risk of genital infection. METHODS: Secondary data analysis using health records from a large sexually transmitted disease clinic in Melbourne of 1710 men and their female partners attending on the same day from January 2006 to April 2015. Proportions of female partners with symptoms suggesting genital infection or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) were determined for: (1) men with NGU and no Chlamydia trachomatis or Mycoplasma genitalium (referred to as pathogen-negative NGU) (n = 91); 2) men with urethral C. trachomatis (n = 176); 3) men with urethral M. genitalium (n = 26); and 4) asymptomatic men (n = 652). RESULTS: Female partners of men with pathogen-negative NGU experienced deep pelvic pain (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.4), post coital bleeding (AOR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.9), and dysuria (AOR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.6-8.6) more commonly and were diagnosed with PID more commonly (AOR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.1-11.3) than the female partners of asymptomatic men. Pelvic inflammatory disease was not more likely to be diagnosed in the female partners of men with genital warts (AOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.5-4.4) or candidiasis (AOR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.4-3.5) than the female partners of asymptomatic men. The female partners of men with chlamydia experienced post coital bleeding more (AOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.6) and were more likely to be diagnosed with PID (AOR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.6-8.0). CONCLUSIONS: The female partners of men with pathogen-negative NGU may be at increased risk of genital infection, even if a recognised pathogen is not identified in the man."
0,"Chlamydia Trachomatis Infection and Tubal Infertility in Port Harcourt, Southern,Nigeria",,"BACKGROUND: Tubal occlusion remains one the commonest causes of infertility in our environment and previous pelvic infection have been implicated in the aetiology of the blockage Objective: To demonstrate prior chlamydia infection in women with tubal factor infertility and ascertain the relationship between chlamydia and tubal occlusion. METHODS: This was a case-control study consisting of 188 patients drawn from the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH) Port Harcourt, South-South Nigeria.The cases were 94 women with radiologically confirmed tubal occlusion and the controls were another 94 women with intrauterine pregnancy, all screened for the presence of chlamydia immunoglobin G antibody in the serum using Immunocomb Chlamydia Bivalent IgG kit, Orgenics, Israel.Their socio-demographic characteristics and the pattern of sexual behaviour were documented in the profoma provided. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 17 statistical software. RESULTS: The prevalence of Chlamydia antibodies was significantly higher in patients with tubal factor infertility (61.7%) than in the pregnant controls (34%) as p=0.001 and was associated with a three-fold risk of tubal factor infertility, with Odd's ratio (O.R) 3.12. CONCLUSION: There was a risk association between Chlamydia Trachomatis infection and tubal factor infertility. Early coitarche and previous pelvic inflammatory disease were other risk factors of Chlamydia trachomatis infection found to be positively associated with tubal factor infertility."
1,Risk of reproductive complications following chlamydia testing: a population-based retrospective cohort study in Denmark,10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30092-5,"BACKGROUND: Uncertainty in the risk of reproductive complications (pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal factor infertility) following chlamydia infection and repeat infection hampers the design of evidence-based chlamydia control programmes. We estimate the association between diagnosed chlamydia and episodes of hospital health care (inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department) for a reproductive complication. METHODS: We constructed and analysed a retrospective population-based cohort of women aged 15-44 years from administrative records in Denmark (1995-2012). We used a subset of the national Danish Chlamydia Study. The master dataset contains all residents of Denmark (including Greenland) who had a positive chlamydia test recorded by a public health microbiology laboratory from Jan 1, 1992, to Nov 2, 2011. Individuals were randomly matched (by age and sex) to four individuals drawn from the population register (Danish Civil Registration System) who did not have a positive chlamydia test during this interval. The outcomes in the study were hospital episodes of health-care (inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department) with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, or tubal factor infertility. FINDINGS: The 516 720 women (103 344 positive, 182 879 negative, 230 497 never-tested) had a mean follow-up of 7·96 years. Compared with women with only negative tests, the risk of each complication was 30% higher in women with one or more positive tests (pelvic inflammatory disease, adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1·50 [95% CI 1·43-1·57]; ectopic pregnancy, AHR 1·31 [1·25-1·38]; tubal factor infertility, AHR 1·37 [1·24-1·52]) and 60% lower in women who were never-tested (pelvic inflammatory disease, AHR 0·33 [0·31-0·35]; ectopic pregnancy, AHR 0·42 [0·39-0·44]; tubal factor infertility AHR 0·29 [0·25-0·33]). A positive test had a minor absolute impact on health as the difference in the lifetime incidence of complications was small between women who tested positive and those who tested negative (pelvic inflammatory disease, 0·6%; ectopic pregnancy, 0·2%; tubal factor infertility, 0·1%). Repeat infections increased the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease by a further 20% (AHR 1·20, 95% CI 1·11-1·31). INTERPRETATION: A single diagnosed chlamydia infection increased the risk of all complications and a repeat diagnosed infection further increased the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Therefore, control programmes must prevent first and repeat infections to improve women's reproductive health.

0,Cervicitis: How Often Is It Non-specific!,10.7860/JCDR/2015/11594.5673,"BACKGROUND: Uterine cervix is most often reported as 'non specific cervicitis'. It is an effort to encourage specific reporting and thereby avoiding the term 'non specific' to a possible extent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study is carried out on 613 specimens of uterine cervix received at Department of Pathology, Aarupadai Veedu Medical College, Pondicherry, between 1(st) January 2010 to 31(st) December 2012. Histopathology slides of all the cases were studied for the presence of specific features of various inflammatory lesions. RESULTS are expressed in percentage. RESULTS: Chronic nonspecific cervicitis was the commonest inflammatory lesion constituting 89.23% of the cases. Other inflammatory lesions were follicular cervicitis in 6.85%, chronic cervicitis with koilocytosis in 3.75% and only one case (0.16%) of tuberculosis was observed. CONCLUSION: Importance of these benign lesions of the uterine cervix lies in the fact that some of them like Chlamydia, Papilloma infection have specific treatment and some of them form differential diagnosis for malignant lesions and some progress to malignancy."
1,Factors associated with pelvic inflammatory disease: A case series analysis of family planning clinic data,10.1177/17455057221112263,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to better understand factors associated with pelvic inflammatory disease in an outpatient setting. METHODS: We analysed the characteristics of pelvic inflammatory disease cases diagnosed in an outpatient setting during 2018. There were 72 cases included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Of the pelvic inflammatory disease cases analysed, 55% were idiopathic, 22.2% were related to a sexually transmitted infection, and 22.2% had onset of symptoms within 6 weeks of a gynaecological procedure. Of the sexually transmitted infection-positive pelvic inflammatory disease cases, Chlamydia trachomatis was present in 56%, Mycoplasma genitalium was present in 38%, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was present in 12.5% of cases. Many pelvic inflammatory disease cases had evidence of vaginal dysbiosis or features associated with vaginal flora disruption (recent antibiotic usage and/or vulvovaginal candidiasis). CONCLUSION: This case series highlights the burden of Mycoplasma genitalium pelvic inflammatory disease, and clinicians should be aware to include testing for this when diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease. Our findings also support the hypothesis that host dysbiotic microbiota may contribute to pelvic inflammatory disease pathogenesis, with further research required to explore this proposition."
1,Screening for chlamydia and/or gonorrhea in primary health care: systematic reviews on effectiveness and patient preferences,10.1186/s13643-021-01658-w,"BACKGROUND: We conducted systematic reviews on the benefits and harms of screening compared with no screening or alternative screening approaches for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in non-pregnant sexually active individuals, and on the relative importance patients' place on the relevant outcomes. Findings will inform recommendations by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. METHODS: We searched five databases (to January 24, 2020), trial registries, conference proceedings, and reference lists for English and French literature published since 1996. Screening, study selection, and risk of bias assessments were independently undertaken by two reviewers, with consensus for final decisions. Data extraction was conducted by one reviewer and checked by another for accuracy and completeness. Meta-analysis was conducted where appropriate. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence. The Task Force and content experts provided input on determining thresholds for important effect sizes and on interpretation of findings. RESULTS: Of 41 included studies, 17 and 11 reported on benefits and harms of screening, respectively, and 14 reported on patient preferences. Universal screening for CT in general populations 16 to 29 years of age, using population-based or opportunistic approaches achieving low screening rates, may make little-to-no difference for a female's risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (2 RCTs, n=141,362; 0.3 more in 1000 [7.6 fewer to 11 more]) or ectopic pregnancy (1 RCT, n=15,459; 0.20 more per 1000 [2.2 fewer to 3.9 more]). It may also not make a difference for CT transmission (3 RCTs, n=41,709; 3 fewer per 1000 [11.5 fewer to 6.9 more]). However, benefits may be achieved for reducing PID if screening rates are increased (2 trials, n=30,652; 5.7 fewer per 1000 [10.8 fewer to 1.1 more]), and for reducing CT and NG transmission when intensely screening high-prevalence female populations (2 trials, n=6127; 34.3 fewer per 1000 [4 to 58 fewer]; NNS 29 [17 to 250]). Evidence on infertility in females from CT screening and on transmission of NG in males and both sexes from screening for CT and NG is very uncertain. No evidence was found for cervicitis, chronic pelvic pain, or infertility in males from CT screening, or on any clinical outcomes from NG screening. Undergoing screening, or having a diagnosis of CT, may cause a small-to-moderate number of people to experience some degree of harm, mainly due to feelings of stigmatization and anxiety about future infertility risk. The number of individuals affected in the entire screening-eligible population is likely smaller. Screening may make little-to-no difference for general anxiety, self-esteem, or relationship break-up. Evidence on transmission from studies comparing home versus clinic screening is very uncertain. Four studies on patient preferences found that although utility values for the different consequences of CT and NG infections are probably quite similar, when considering the duration of the health state experiences, infertility and chronic pelvic pain are probably valued much more than PID, ectopic pregnancy, and cervicitis. How patients weigh the potential benefits versus harms of screening is very uncertain (1 survey, 10 qualitative studies); risks to reproductive health and transmission appear to be more important than the (often transient) psychosocial harms. DISCUSSION: Most of the evidence on screening for CT and/or NG offers low or very low certainty about the benefits and harms. Indirectness from use of comparison groups receiving some screening, incomplete outcome ascertainment, and use of outreach settings was a major contributor to uncertainty. Patient preferences indicate that the potential benefits from screening appear to outweigh the possible harms. Direct evidence about which screening strategies and intervals to use, which age to start and stop screening, and whether screening males in addition to females is necessary to prevent clinical outcomes is scarce, and further research in these areas would be informative. Apart from the evidence in this review, information on factors related to equity, acceptability, implementation, cost/resources, and feasibility will support recommendations made by the Task Force.

1,"Chlamydia trachomatis and the Risk of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, Ectopic Pregnancy, and Female Infertility: A Retrospective Cohort Study Among Primary Care Patients",10.1093/cid/ciz429,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, and infertility in women with a previous Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) diagnosis compared with women who tested negative for CT and CT untested women, considering both targeted and incidental (ie, prescribed for another indication) use of CT-effective antibiotics. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of women aged 12-25 years at start of follow-up within the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD database linked to index of multiple deprivation quintiles, 2000-2013. CT test status and antibiotic use were determined in a time-dependent manner. Risk of PID, ectopic pregnancy, or female infertility were evaluated using of Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: We studied 857 324 women, contributing 6 457 060 person-years. Compared with women who tested CT-negative, women who tested CT-positive had an increased risk of PID (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.01-2.79), ectopic pregnancy (aHR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.38-2.54), and infertility (aHR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.27-2.68). The PID risk was higher for women with 2 or more positive CT tests than those with 1 positive test. PID risk increased with the number of previous antibiotic prescriptions, regardless of CT test status. CONCLUSIONS: We showed an association between CT-positive tests and 3 adverse reproductive health outcomes. Moreover, this risk increased with repeat CT infections. CT-effective antibiotic use showed no decreased risks of subsequent PID regardless of CT history. Our results confirm the reproductive health burden of CT, which requires adequate public health interventions."
0,The sexual health of female sex workers compared with other women in England: analysis of cross-sectional data from genitourinary medicine clinics,10.1136/sextrans-2013-051381,"BACKGROUND: While female sex workers (FSWs) are assumed to be at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), there are limited comparative data with other population groups available. Using routine STI surveillance data, we investigated differences in sexual health between FSWs and other female attendees at genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in England. METHODS: Demographic characteristics, STI prevalence and service usage among FSWs and other attendees in 2011 were compared using logistic regression. RESULTS: In 2011, 2704 FSWs made 8411 recorded visits to 131/208 GUM clinics, (primarily large, FSW-specialist centres in London). FSWs used a variety of services, however, 10% did not have an STI/HIV test at presentation. By comparison with other female attendees, FSWs travelled further for their care and had increased risk of certain STIs (e.g., gonorrhoea ORadj: 2.76, 95% CI 2.16 to 3.54, p<0.001). Migrant FSWs had better sexual health outcomes than UK-born FSWs (e.g., period prevalence of chlamydia among those tested: 8.5% vs 13.5%, p<0.001) but were more likely to experience non-STI outcomes (eg, pelvic inflammatory disease ORadj: 2.92, 95% CI 1.57 to 5.41, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FSWs in England have access to high-quality care through the GUM clinic network, but there is evidence of geographical inequality in access to these services. A minority do not appear to access STI/HIV testing through clinics, and some STIs are more prevalent among FSWs than other female attendees. Targeted interventions aimed at improving uptake of testing in FSWs should be developed, and need to be culturally sensitive to the needs of this predominantly migrant population."
0,Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Chlamydia trachomatis Vaccine Program in Adolescent Girls in the United States,10.1093/jpids/pix072,"BACKGROUND: With >1.4 million cases in the United States reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2012, Chlamydia trachomatis infection is a major public health concern. We examined the impact of a C trachomatis vaccination program using a decision-analysis model to estimate the effects of vaccination on C trachomatis-associated costs and morbidity. METHODS: We developed a Markov model considering a cohort of 2158117 US females aged 9 to 26 years. Morbidity, death, and healthcare-associated costs associated with chlamydial infection of mothers and fetuses/neonates were calculated over a 17-year time frame. We developed 2 major comparison arms, namely, a C trachomatis vaccination program and no C trachomatis vaccination program. Base-case efficacy and coverage were set to those of human papillomavirus in the United States with all variables, including efficacy and coverage, ranged in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: On the basis of a base-case analysis, a vaccination program would cost an estimated $710 million for a cohort of 2158117 women over a 17-year period, an increase of $41 million over having no vaccination program. A vaccination program would prevent 34000 cases of C trachomatis infection and 5976 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease. CONCLUSIONS: A C trachomatis vaccination program results in increased cost to the healthcare system but averts significant morbidity and death."
0,Successful Provision of Long-Acting Reversible Contraception in a Sexual Health Clinic,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001625,"BACKGROUND: Women who attend sexual health clinics are at high risk for sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) are very effective contraceptive methods, but the provision of LARC in such clinics is not well described in the literature. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of women who presented to Denver Sexual Health Clinic for any reason and received family planning services between April 1, 2016, and October 31, 2018. We assessed demographic and clinical factors associated with contraceptive method received and conducted a subanalysis of those with intrauterine device (IUD) insertions on the same-day versus delayed insertion. Among those who received an IUD, we assessed rates of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) 30 days after insertion. RESULTS: Of the 5064 women who received family planning services in our clinic, 1167 (23%) were using a LARC method at the time of their visit. Of the 3897 who were not using a LARC, fewer women, 12.6%, chose LARC (IUD and progestin implant), compared with 33.3% who chose new short-acting reversible contraceptives. Further analysis of the 270 IUD initiators revealed 202 (74.8%) received the IUD on the same day, whereas 68 (25.2%) had delayed IUD insertion. There were 9 incident cases of gonorrhea or chlamydia in those who received same-day IUD and 1 incident case among those who had delayed IUD insertion. There were no cases of PID at 30 days after insertion in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings support IUD provision in a sexual health clinic on the day of initial visit without increased risk of PID."
0,Chlamydia Peritonitis and Ascites Mimicking Ovarian Cancer,10.1155/2016/8547173,"Background. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) rarely results in diffuse ascites. Severe adhesive disease secondary to PID may lead to the formation of inclusion cysts and even pelvic peritoneal nodularity due to postinflammatory scarring and cause an elevation of serum CA-125 levels. The constellation of these findings may mimic an ovarian neoplasm. Case. We report a case of a 22-year-old female who presented with multiple pelvic cysts and diffuse ascites due to Chlamydia trachomatis infection. The initial gynecologic exam did not reveal obvious evidence of PID; however, a positive Chlamydia trachomatis test, pathologic findings, and the exclusion of other etiologies facilitated the diagnosis. Conclusion. Chlamydia trachomatis and other infectious agents should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a young sexually active female with abdominal pain, ascites, and pelvic cystic masses. Thorough workup in such a population may reduce the number of more invasive procedures as well as unnecessary repeat surgical procedures."
0,Predictive Markers of Tubo-Ovarian Abscess in Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,10.1159/000381772,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The purpose of this study was to identify predictive markers for tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) through a comparison of clinical and laboratory data in patients diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). METHODS: We reviewed the medical charts of 499 females who were admitted to hospital with clinical, surgical, imaging-based diagnoses of PID between 2001 and 2011. The patients were divided into the following two groups: (1) PID with TOA and (2) PID without TOA. RESULTS: The TOA and non-TOA groups were comprised of 69 and 430 females, respectively. Mean age, history of intrauterine device (IUD) insertion and inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP) and CA-125 levels, were higher in the TOA group than the non-TOA group. Independent factors that predicted TOA were older age, IUD insertion, increased CRP and CA-125, and chlamydia infection. CA-125 was found to have the highest predictive value for TOA. TOA size was associated with increased surgical therapy compared to patients with smaller abscesses. CONCLUSIONS: Increased age, IUD insertion, chlamydia infection, and increased CRP and CA-125 level were the independent factors predictive of TOA in acute PID. These predictive values will be expected to help decrease gynecological morbidity by early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of TOA. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel."
0,Bacterial Vaginosis and Post-Operative Pelvic Infections.,10.3390/healthcare11091218,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) represents a condition in which the normal protective Lactobacilli, especially those that produce H(2)O(2), are replaced by high  quantities of facultative anaerobes, leading to gynecologic and obstetric  post-operative complications. BV is an important cause of obstetric and  gynecological adverse sequelae and it could lead to an increased risk of  contracting sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea, genital herpes,  Chlamydia, Trichomonas, and human immunodeficiency virus. Herein, we reviewed  bacterial vaginosis and its association with post-operative pelvic infections. In  Obstetrics, BV has been associated with increased risk of preterm delivery,  first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing in vitro fertilization, preterm  premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, amniotic fluid infections,  postpartum and postabortal endomyometritis as well as postabortal pelvic  inflammatory disease (PID). In gynecology, BV increases the risk of  post-hysterectomy infections such as vaginal cuff cellulitis, pelvic cellulitis,  pelvic abscess, and PID. BV is often asymptomatic, can resolve spontaneously, and  often relapses with or without treatment. The American College of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists recommends testing for BV in women having an increased risk for  preterm delivery. Women with symptoms should be evaluated and treated. Women with  BV undergoing gynecological surgeries must be treated to reduce the frequency of  post-operative pelvic infections. Metronidazole and clindamycin are the mainstays  of therapy. Currently, there is no consensus on pre-surgery screening for BV;  decisions are made on a case-by-case basis."
0,Primary Human Uterine Leiomyoma Cell Culture Quality Control: Some Properties of Myometrial Cells Cultured under Serum Deprivation Conditions in the Presence of Ovarian Steroids,10.1371/journal.pone.0158578,"Cell culture is considered the standard media used in research to emulate the in vivo cell environment. Crucial in vivo experiments cannot be conducted in humans and depend on in vitro methodologies such as cell culture systems. However, some procedures involving the quality control of cells in culture have been gradually neglected by failing to acknowledge that primary cells and cell lines change over time in culture. Thus, we report methods based on our experience for monitoring primary cell culture of human myometrial cells derived from uterine leiomyoma. We standardized the best procedure of tissue dissociation required for the study of multiple genetic marker systems that include species-specific antigens, expression of myofibroblast or myoblast markers, growth curve, serum deprivation, starvation by cell cycle synchronization, culture on collagen coated plates, and 17 β-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) effects. The results showed that primary myometrial cells from patients with uterine leiomyoma displayed myoblast phenotypes before and after in vitro cultivation, and leiomyoma cells differentiated into mature myocyte cells under the appropriate differentiation-inducing conditions (serum deprivation). These cells grew well on collagen coated plates and responded to E2 and P4, which may drive myometrial and leiomyoma cells to proliferate and adhere into a focal adhesion complex involvement in a paracrine manner. The establishment of these techniques as routine procedures will improve the understanding of the myometrial physiology and pathogenesis of myometrium-derived diseases such as leiomyoma. Mimicking the in vivo environment of fibrotic conditions can prevent false results and enhance results that are based on cell culture integrity."
0,Prevalence of human papilloma virus and Chlamydia trachomatis in endometrial and cervical carcinoma: a comparative study in North Indian women.,10.1080/19396368.2023.2247517,"Cervical cancer (Cacx) is the second and endometrial cancer (Ec) is the third most common gynecological cancer worldwide. The present study aims to understand  the complex and unexplored conditions occurring in cervix and endometrium of the  female genital tract caused due to the infection of the human papilloma viruses  (HPVs) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). A total of 300 tissue biopsy samples of  cervix and endometrium were included in the present study and tested for the  presence of HPV and CT deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by using polymerase chain  reaction (PCR) technique. The odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were  considered for the calculation of the association of HPV and CT infection with  the risk of cervical or Ec. Among endometrial patients, samples were 5% positive  for HPV and 5% positive for CT infection. Among endometrial control group, no  sample was found positive for either HPV or CT infection. Among cervical  patients, 72% samples were positive for only HPV infection and 1% samples were  positive for only CT infection. Among control group, 7% of samples were positive  for only HPV infection and 3% were positive for only CT infection. The  co-infection of CT with HPV in 9% of Cacx cases and in 2% of cervical control  samples was also observed. This is the first study in Indian women to detect the  prevalence of HPV and CT infections in endometrium cases and control. An updated  estimate regarding the HPV and CT prevalence in cervix cases and control samples  was also provided."
0,Elimination of Human Papillomavirus and Cervical Pathological Microbiota with Photodynamic Therapy in Women from Mexico City with Cervical Intraepithelial  Neoplasia I.,10.1111/php.13791,"Cervical carcinoma (CC) is the second cause of cancer death in Mexican women. It starts with premalignant lesions known as Intraepithelial Cervical Neoplasia  (CIN) that can develop due to infection by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and other  microorganisms. Current CIN therapy involves invasive methods that affect cervix  integrity and fertility; we propose the use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) as a  strategy with few side effects. In this work, the effectiveness of PDT for CIN I,  HPV and pathogenic vaginal microbiota elimination in 29 women of Mexico City with  CIN I, CIN I + HPV and HPV diagnosis was determined. After 6 months of PDT  application, HPV infection was eliminated in 100% of the patients (P < 0.01), CIN  I + HPV in 64.3% (P < 0.01) and CIN I in 57.2% (P > 0.05). PDT also eliminated  pathogenic microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis in 81% of the women (P < 0.001)  and Candida albicans in 80% (P < 0.05), without affecting normal microbiota since  Lactobacillus iners was eliminated only in 5.8% of patients and the opportunistic  Gardnerella vaginalis in 20%. These results show that PDT was highly effective in  eradicating HPV and pathogenic microorganisms, suggesting that PDT is a promising  therapy for cervical infections."
0,Prevalence of cervical-vaginal infections in the pap-smear samples in Iran,10.5539/gjhs.v6n1p201,"Cervical-vaginal infection is one of the most common problems in clinical medicine .We aimed to determine the prevalence of cervical-vaginal infections in pap-smear samples from women in urban and rural areas. METHOD: It was a cross - sectional study which had done on 1448 non-pregnant women those had attended 12 health centers in the Dashte- Azadegan city during 2007-2011, Iran. After explained the aim of study, all subjects had signed informed consent, questionnaires regarding demographic and reproductive characteristics, and contraceptive methods used were completed by researcher. Also, pap-smear samples were prepared by a trained obstetrician and sent it to the pathology laboratory. All data were analyzed using SPSS (version 19). Descriptive and analytical statistics (chi - square test) were also applied. RESULTS: The result showed that 55.9% and 44.1% of subjects were respectively in urban and rural areas. The mean age of women was 28±8.075. Pap smear results had shown that 8.8% of samples were infected with one of microorganisms such as Chlamydia, Candida, Cardnerella, and Trichomonas. A significant association was seen between contraceptive methods, education levels and place of residence with cervical-vaginal infections. CONCLUSION: The most prevalent pathogens by descending order were: Candida, Trichomonas and Gardenerella. The prevalence of cervical-vaginal infections was consistent with the results of many studies but it was different with the results of some studies. This could be due to the special conditions of social, economic and cultural of each area."
0,Interferon-gamma gene polymorphism influences the frequency of a Chlamydia trachomatis cervical infection in young women,10.1177/0956462414563627,"Cervicitis associated with Chlamydia trachomatis is frequent worldwide, but the factors determining susceptibility to infection remain incompletely determined. We evaluated whether a functional single nucleotide polymorphism at position +874 in the gene coding for interferon gamma (rs2430561) influenced the likelihood of having a cervical C. trachomatis infection. This was a cross-sectional study of 142 sexually-active women attending a general gynaecology service on the outskirts of the city of Fortaleza in northeastern Brazil between August 2011 and August 2012. Endocervical swabs were evaluated for C. trachomatis DNA using hybrid capture. DNA from buccal swabs was utilised for detection of the interferon gamma 874 T/A single nucleotide polymorphism by gene amplification, endonuclease digestion and gel electrophoresis. Nineteen women (13.4%) were positive for C. trachomatis in their cervix. Positivity was 21.7% in women with the A,A genotype versus 7.0% in women with one or two T alleles (p = 0.0227). The variant T allele frequency, associated with elevated interferon gamma production, was 36.2% in women who were negative for C. trachomatis as opposed to 18.4% in women who were positive for a cervical infection with this organism (p = 0.0415). Possession of the T allele at position +874 in the gene coding for interferon gamma is associated with a reduced likelihood of a C. trachomatis cervical infection."
0,Cervicitis of unknown etiology,10.1007/s11908-014-0409-x,"Cervicitis has been described by some as the female counterpart of urethritis in men. Over the years a number of clinical and microscopy-based definitions have been suggested in the literature. Clinical manifestations include mucopurulent discharge from the cervix, cervical friability (easy bleeding from the cervix with passage of a swab) and cervical ectopy. Microscopic definitions involving the use of Gram stain of cervical secretions have included either more than 10 white blood cells (WBCs) or more than 30 WBCs per high-power field. Combinations of these clinical and microscopic findings have been used in attempts to increase the accuracy of cervicitis diagnosis. When cervicitis was initially recognized as a clinical entity, several investigators reported the primary pathogens causing cervicitis as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. It is now well established that most cases of cervicitis are not caused by these two organisms. Most cases of cervicitis are of unknown etiology."
0,Mycoplasma genitalium infection is associated with microscopic signs of cervical inflammation in liquid cytology specimens,10.1128/JCM.00159-14,"Cervicitis is a common clinical finding often attributed to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but no etiologic agent is identified in the majority of cases. In this study, we comparatively assessed inflammation among the common infectious etiologies of cervicitis and assessed the potential value of liquid cytology specimens for predicting STIs. Among 473 Louisiana women at low risk for acquiring STIs, the prevalences of Mycoplasma genitalium, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis in liquid-based cytology specimens were 1.5, 2.1, 0.6, and 4.4%, respectively. N. gonorrhoeae and human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18) infections were significantly more common among subjects infected with M. genitalium. Using direct microscopy, we observed significant increases in leukocyte infiltrates among subjects with monoinfections with M. genitalium or C. trachomatis compared to women with no detectable STIs. Inflammation was highest among subjects with M. genitalium. Using a threshold of ≥ 2 leukocytes per epithelial cell per high-powered field, the positive predictive values for M. genitalium, C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. vaginalis were 100, 70, 67, and 20%, respectively. Several novel M. genitalium genotypes were identified, all of which were predicted to be susceptible to macrolide antibiotics, suggesting that different strains may circulate among low-risk women and that macrolide resistance is substantially lower than in high-risk populations. This study highlights the capacity of M. genitalium to elicit cervical inflammation and, considering the strong epidemiologic associations between M. genitalium and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), provides a potential mechanism for acquisition and shedding of HIV via chronic leukocyte recruitment to the cervical mucosa."
0,Chinese Herbal Formula Feilin Vaginal Gel Prevents the Cervicitis in Mouse Model,10.1155/2019/4168126,"Cervicitis is a common sexually transmitted disease. In recent years, the abuse of antibiotic in the treatment of cervicitis results in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria; alternative strategies are needed to be developed. In this research, we investigated the effects of Feilin Vaginal Gel (FVG), a Chinese herbal formula, on the treatment of cervicitis. Two cervicitis models were optimized using BALB/c mouse; one in vitro model was established in HeLa cells. In Chlamydia trachomatis-induced cervicitis model, the high level of bacterial loads, the inflammation in tissue, and the cytokines in serum could be observed. With the administration of FVG, the bacterial loads in cervical mucus and cervix tissue could be significantly inhibited in dose-dependent manners. The pathological injury of cervix and vagina, as well as the levels of IL-2, IL-17, and MCP-1 in serum, could be mitigated by FVG. FVG reduced the number of inclusion induced by C. trachomatis in HeLa cells. In addition, the histological damage in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus-induced cervicitis model could be reduced by FVG. These results suggest that FVG is capable of treating cervicitis through the inhibition of pathogens and the regulation of host immune responses. FVG may contribute as an alternative agent for the treatment of cervicitis."

The clinical spectrum varies from absence of symptoms to extensive inflammatory processes that may simulate a malignant neoplasm. We present a clinical case of an adolescent with genital ulcers and systemic disease. Speculoscopy revealed a tumoral-looking cervix. Laboratory studies confirm infection with herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) and Mycoplasma genitalium, together with a histological study that ruled out neoplasia. It progresses favorably to antimicrobial treatment, with recovery of the appearance of the cervix. Cervicitis rarely presents with necrotic involvement. Co-infection with HSV-2 and M. genitalium infection may have been the determinant of cervical damage and the necrotic appearance. A thorough evaluation and study with highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests allowed an adequate diagnosis and treatment."
0,"Cervicitis: Etiology, diagnosis and treatment",10.1016/j.eimc.2018.12.004,"Cervicitis is the inflammation of the cervix. It is usually caused by an infectious agent, usually sexually transmitted. Cervicitis is frequently asymptomatic and silent infection can cause complications of the upper genital tract. The symptoms are usually nonspecific, the most significant being an increase in vaginal discharge and/or intermenstrual bleeding. For its diagnosis, there are commercial systems based on molecular techniques that include almost all of the known pathogens associated with cervicitis, although cultures should not be abandoned due to the need to conduct studies of susceptibility to antibiotics. It is recommended to initiate an empirical antibiotic therapy that covers C.trachomatis and N.gonorrhoeae in the case of women at high risk of infection by these pathogens, especially if the follow-up is not assured or adequate diagnostic tests are not available. In women with low risk of sexually transmitted infection, antibiotic therapy should be adjusted to the results of the microbiological results."

0,A pilot clinical validation study of a self-collected vaginal swab device for the detection of chlamydia trachomatis in women,10.3389/fbioe.2022.1008761,"Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) is one of the most prevalent preventable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the world. In women, C. trachomatis infection can lead to long-term complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and other related conditions such as ectopic pregnancies and even tubal factor infertility. These complications are preventable given early detection and clinical intervention, but these efforts are often hampered by asymptomatic silent infections, and non-compliance to screenings for STDs. Some women do not get tested out of concerns for violation of privacy, and fear of discomfort. Clinicians often use a multitude of tests to determine if a patient is infected by C. trachomatis, including a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test of First catch urine (FCU) samples. However, these tend to be inconvenient to store and transport, as they carry risk of spillage and have stringent refrigeration requirements. Moreover, given the gold-standard recommendations set forth by the Centres for Disease Control (CDC), the current technique can be inconvenient in remote areas where refrigeration and transport may not always be reliable. The current study therefore looks at the potential of a self-collected vaginal swab device that relies on Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs), is dry-stored, and does not require refrigeration, to detect the presence of C. trachomatis in women. The study found evidence to suggest that the self-collection device has the potential to aid clinicians in the diagnosis of C. trachomatis in women when compared to doctor-collected vaginal discharge samples as the designated standard, FCU, and blood serology. Moreover, as a self-collection device it has the potential to break down some of the barriers to STD screening especially in young women, such as violation of privacy. The device therefore has a potential to encourage screening and therefore a potentially effective tool in the fight against the spread of preventable sexually transmitted diseases."
1,Alterations of Vaginal Microbiota in Women With Infertility and Chlamydia trachomatis Infection,10.3389/fcimb.2021.698840,"Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) is the most common etiological agent of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) worldwide and causes serious health sequelae such as cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and even infertility if ascending from the lower to the upper female genital tract. Previous studies have revealed the pivotal role of vaginal microbiota in susceptibility to STIs. However, alterations in the vaginal microbiota in women who are infertile and infected with C. trachomatis remain unknown. This study used metagenomic analysis of sequenced 16S rRNA gene amplicons to examine the vaginal microbial profiles of women with tubal infertility who were C. trachomatis-negative and those who were C. trachomatis-positive pre- and post-antibiotic treatment. Women who were C. trachomatis-negative and deemed healthy were recruited as references of eubiosis and dysbiosis. Women with tubal infertility and C. trachomatis infection presented a unique Lactobacillus iners-dominated vaginal microbiota rather than one dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus and displayed a decrease in Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterobacter, Atopobium, and Streptococcus, accompanied by decreased levels of cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-10. This altered vaginal microbiota could be restored with varying degrees after standard treatment for C. trachomatis. This shift could be a predictive vaginal microbiota signature for C. trachomatis infection among females with tubal infertility, while no significant differences in phylum, class, and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) levels were observed between women with tubal infertility who were C. trachomatis-negative and healthy controls. This is the first study to provide data on the association of vaginal microbiota with C. trachomatis infection among women with tubal infertility and highlights unprecedented potential opportunities to predict C. trachomatis infection."
1,What Can Serology Tell Us About the Burden of Infertility in Women Caused by Chlamydia?,10.1093/infdis/jiab047,"Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) causes pelvic inflammatory disease, which may result in tubal factor infertility (TFI) in women. Serologic assays may be used to determine the proportion of women with and without TFI who have had previous CT infection and to generate estimates of infertility attributable to chlamydia. Unfortunately, most existing CT serologic assays are challenged by low sensitivity and, sometimes, specificity for prior CT infection; however, they are currently the only available tests available to detect prior CT infection. Modeling methods such as finite mixture modeling may be a useful adjunct to quantitative serologic data to obtain better estimates of CT-related infertility. In this article, we review CT serological assays, including the use of antigens preferentially expressed during upper genital tract infection, and suggest future research directions. These methodologic improvements, coupled with creation of new biomarkers for previous CT infection, should improve our understanding of chlamydia's contribution to female infertility."
0,[Chlamydia trachomatis infection's eradication : a daily goal],,"Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection is the most frequent notifiable sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Switzerland. The infection is most frequently observed in 15 to 24 year-old-women and in 25 to 34 year-old-men. 50-75 % of the Chlamydia trachomatis carriage are asymptomatic, making the infection difficult to diagnose and increasing the untreated specimen, leading to complications like infertility, ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease. Despite having a sexual prevention at school, the youths seem to have a lack of knowledge about CT, her transmission and her complications. We performed a survey, which showed that 60.5 % of the participants ignored that this bacteria is mostly asymptomatic. We also found that 11 % of the participants believed that there is no possible relapse of the infection. The prevention must be strengthened, mostly because there is no program in Switzerland, letting every physician to his own beliefs. The medical consultation is an ideal opportunity for this prevention and the youths shared their wish to discuss more about it with health professionals."
0,The Role of Chlamydia Trachomatis in the Pathogenesis of Cervical Cancer,10.7759/cureus.21331,"Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is an obligate intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium that causes a variety of infections in both humans and animals. It is the causative agent of one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with sequelae such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Furthermore, Chlamydia infections have been epidemiologically linked to cervical cancer (CC) in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) coinfection. However, a molecular mechanism linking Chlamydia to CC is yet to be established, and we still do not know if more aggressive diagnosis and treatment of Chlamydia could possibly lead to lower incidences of CC and associated mortality. Since CC is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, and HPV infection alone is insufficient to cause cancer, our goal was to determine the link between Chlamydia, HPV, and CC. This literature review aimed to understand the pathologic model of CC and how Chlamydia might induce or promote carcinogenesis alone or alongside HPV. In addition, we compared multiple studies attempting to associate Chlamydial infection with CC in different populations and aimed to determine whether there is an epidemiological correlation or not."

In Italy, Ct prevalence is low in general population, but predominance of asymptomatic infections, passive voluntary reporting, variable diagnostic criteria and coding practices can lead to considerable underestimation, preventing assessment of real burden of disease and health intervention. We analysed data on female genital Ct infection registered in STI sentinel surveillance systems in Italy from 2005 through 2016 and found 3305 women. Among them, those aged 20-24 years had the highest disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) estimation equal to 106.77 DALYs per 100 000-stratum specific population. Through the study period, incidence rate (IR) for female Ct infection increased significantly from 2.9 to 7.1 per 100 000 resident population. Besides, we analysed data on pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) reported from the National Hospital Information system (NHIS) in the same period. We found 287 women hospitalised with concurrent PID and Ct infection. We recommend targeted screening programmes in women aged 20-24, definition of nationwide active surveillance system, standardisation of diagnostic criteria and ICD-9CM coding practices."

It is asymptomatic in most cases and mainly affects young women, with potential long term sequelae (pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal infertility, obstetric complications). The impact on male fertility is controversial. Screening methods as well as antibiotics use have recently been reassessed due to resistance phenomena and the negative effect on the urogenital microbiota. Positive CT serology may be indicative of tuboperitoneal pathology, which may not be noticed on hysterosalpingography. New research on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) aims to establish a patient profile at higher risk of infectious tubal damage due to CT. CT seropositivity is also associated with decreased spontaneous pregnancy rates and is a predictive factor for obstetrical complications."

Untreated urogenital infection in women can  result in adverse sequelae such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.  Despite national screening and treatment guidelines, rates continue to rise;  because most infections are asymptomatic, the actual prevalence of CT infection  is likely significantly higher than reported. Spontaneous clearance of CT in  women (in the absence of antibiotic treatment) has been described in multiple  epidemiologic studies. Given the serious consequences and high prevalence of CT  infection, there is growing interest in understanding this phenomenon and factors  that may promote CT clearance in women. Spontaneous CT clearance is likely the  result of complex interactions between CT, the host immune system, and the  vaginal microbiota (i.e., the communities of bacteria inhabiting the vagina),  which has been implicated in CT acquisition. Herein, we briefly review current  literature regarding the role of each of these factors in spontaneous CT  clearance, identify knowledge gaps, and discuss future directions and possible  implications for the development of novel interventions that may protect against  CT infection, facilitate clearance, and prevent reproductive sequelae."
0,Using an agent-based sexual-network model to analyze the impact of mitigation efforts for controlling chlamydia,10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100456,"Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most reported sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with a major cause of infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ectopic pregnancy among women. Despite decades of screening women for Ct, rates increase among young African Americans (AA). We create and analyze a heterosexual agent-based network model to help understand the spread of Ct. We calibrate the model parameters to agree with survey data showing Ct prevalence of 12% of the women and 10% of the men in the 15-25 year-old AA in New Orleans, Louisiana. Our model accounts for both long-term and casual partnerships. The network captures the assortative mixing of individuals by preserving the joint-degree distributions observed in the data. We compare the effectiveness of intervention strategies based on randomly screening men, notifying partners of infected people, which includes partner treatment, partner screening, and rescreening for infection. We compare the difference between treating partners of an infected person both with and without testing them. We observe that although increased Ct screening, rescreening, and treating most of the partners of infected people will reduce the prevalence, these mitigations alone are not sufficient to control the epidemic. The current practice is to treat the partners of an infected individual without first testing them for infection. The model predicts that if a sufficient number of the partners of all infected people are tested and treated, then there is a threshold condition where the epidemic can be mitigated. This threshold results from the expanded treatment network created by treating an individual's infected partners' partners. Although these conclusions can help design future Ct mitigation studies, we caution the reader that these conclusions are for the mathematical model, not the real world, and are contingent on the validity of the model assumptions."

In this Perspective, we present a case for considering the challenges of Ct  vaccine development through a lens of equity and justice. These challenges  include the need to protect against multiple serovars, in both females and males,  at multiple anatomic sites, and in resource poor areas of the world.

In this Perspective, we discuss the successful human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine as a case study to inform Ct vaccine efforts. Areas covered: The immunological basis of HPV vaccine-elicited protection is high-titer, long-lasting antibody responses in the genital tract which provides sterilizing immunity. These antibodies are elicited through parenteral administration of a subunit vaccine based on virus-like particles (VLPs) of HPV. We present three lessons learned from the successful HPV vaccine efforts: (1) antibodies alone can be sufficient to provide protection from STIs in the genital tract, (2) the successful generation of high antibody levels is due to the multivalent structure of HPV VLPs, (3) major challenges exist in designing vaccines that elicit appropriate effector T cells in the genital tract. We then discuss the possibility of antibody-based immunity for Ct. Expert commentary: In this Perspective, we present a case for developing antibody-eliciting vaccines, similar to the HPV vaccine, for Ct. Basic research into the mechanisms of Ct entry into host cells will reveal new vaccine targets, which may be antigens against which antibodies are not normally elicited during natural infection."

Different major outer membrane proteins (MOMPs) define various serovars of this intracellular pathogen: In women, D to L3 can cause urethritis, cervicitis, salpingitis, and oophoritis, and, thus, infertility. Protective immunity might be serovar-specific since chlamydial infection does not appear to induce an effective acquired immunity and reinfections occur. A better understanding of induced cross-serovar protection is essential for the selection of suitable antigens in vaccine development. In our mouse lung infection screening model, we evaluated the urogenital serovars D, E, and L2 in this regard. Seven weeks after primary infection or mock-infection, respectively, mice were infected a second time with the identical or one of the other serovars. Body weight and clinical score were monitored for 7 days. Near the peak of the second lung infection, bacterial load, myeloperoxidase, IFN-γ, and TNF-α in lung homogenate, as well as chlamydia-specific IgG levels in blood were determined. Surprisingly, compared with mice that were infected then for the first time, almost independent of the serovar combination used, all acquired parameters of disease were similarly diminished. Our reinfection study suggests that efficient cross-serovar protection could be achieved by a vaccine combining chlamydial antigens that do not include nonconserved MOMP regions."

A fast-to-perform mouse model is urgently needed to analyze new antibiotics, vaccine candidates, immune responses (in gene knockout animals) or mutants of C. trachomatis. To complement the valuable urogenital model with a much faster and quantifiable screening method, we established an optimized lung infection model for the human intracellular bacterium C. trachomatis serovar D (and L2) in immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice. We demonstrated its usefulness by sensitive determination of antibiotic effects characterizing advantages and limitations achievable by early or delayed short tetracycline treatment and single-dose azithromycin application. Moreover, we achieved partial acquired protection in reinfection with serovar D indicating usability for vaccine studies, and showed a different course of disease in absence of complement factor C3.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and HPV co-infection in different cohorts of asymptomatic women from a Northern Italy area at high incidence for cervical cancer. Cervical samples from 441 females were collected from Cervical Cancer Screening Program, Sexually Transmitted Infectious and Assisted Reproductive Technology centres. HPV and Chlamydia trachomatis were detected simultaneously and genotyped using a highly sensitive bead based assay. The overall prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis was estimated 9.7%, in contrast with the reported national data of 2.3%, and co-infection with HPV was diagnosed in the 17% of the samples. In females ≤ 25 years of age, the infection reached a peak of 22% and co-infection with HPV of 45.8% (P < 0.001). Of note, in young females diagnosed with low grade cervical lesions, no significant difference between Chlamydia trachomatis and HPV distribution was observed, while differently, HPV co-infection was found significantly associated to the presence of intraepithelial lesions when compared to older females (20% vs. 1%; P < 0.001). In this study, the use of a high sensitive molecular technique exhibited higher analytical sensitivity than the referred assays for the diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis and HPV co-infection in asymptomatic females, leading to reduction of the potential to identify incorrectly the infection status. An active screening for timely treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection is suggested in young females to evaluate a possible decrease in incidence of pre-cancer intraepithelial lesions."
0,Development status and future prospects for a vaccine against Chlamydia trachomatis infection,10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.08.020,"Chlamydia trachomatis continues to be the most commonly reported sexually transmitted bacterial infection in many countries with more than 100 million new cases estimated annually. These acute infections translate into significant downstream health care costs, particularly for women, where complications can include pelvic inflammatory disease and other disease sequelae such as tubal factor infertility. Despite years of research, the immunological mechanisms responsible for protective immunity versus immunopathology are still not well understood, although it is widely accepted that T cell driven IFN-g and Th17 responses are critical for clearing infection. While antibodies are able to neutralize infections in vitro, alone they are not protective, indicating that any successful vaccine will need to elicit both arms of the immune response. In recent years, there has been an expansion in the number and types of antigens that have been evaluated as vaccines, and combined with the new array of mucosal adjuvants, this aspect of chlamydial vaccinology is showing promise. Most recently, the opportunities to develop successful vaccines have been given a significant boost with the development of a genetic transformation system for Chlamydia, as well as the identification of the key role of the chlamydial plasmid in virulence. While still remaining a major challenge, the development of a successful C. trachomatis vaccine is starting to look more likely."

If left untreated in women,  genital chlamydia can ascend into the upper genital tract causing pelvic  inflammatory disease, increasing their risk for ectopic pregnancy, infertility,  and chronic pelvic pain. In men, chlamydia can cause epididymitis and proctitis.  However, chlamydia is asymptomatic in over 80% of cases.

0,IL-1α Is Essential for Oviduct Pathology during Genital Chlamydial Infection in Mice,10.4049/jimmunol.2000600,"Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the female genital tract can lead to irreversible fallopian tube scarring. In the mouse model of genital infection using Chlamydia muridarum, IL-1R signaling plays a critical role in oviduct tissue damage. In this study, we investigated the pathologic role of IL-1α, one of the two proinflammatory cytokines that bind to IL-1R. Il1a-/- mice infected with C. muridarum cleared infection at their cervix at the same rate as wild-type (WT) mice, but were significantly protected from end point oviduct damage and fibrosis. The contribution of IL-1α to oviduct pathology was more dramatic than observed in mice deficient for IL-1β. Although chlamydial burden was similar in WT and Il1a-/- oviduct during peak days of infection, levels of IL-1β, IL-6, CSF3, and CXCL2 were reduced in Il1a-/- oviduct lysates. During infection, Il1a-/- oviducts and uterine horns exhibited reduced neutrophil infiltration, and this reduction persisted after the infection resolved. The absence of IL-1α did not compromise CD4 T cell recruitment or function during primary or secondary chlamydial infection. IL-1α is expressed predominantly by luminal cells of the genital tract in response to infection, and low levels of expression persisted after the infection cleared. Ab-mediated depletion of IL-1α in WT mice prevented infection-induced oviduct damage, further supporting a key role for IL-1α in oviduct pathology."
0,Immunization with chlamydial type III secretion antigens reduces vaginal shedding and prevents fallopian tube pathology following live C. muridarum challenge,10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.06.046,"Chlamydia trachomatis infections in women are often asymptomatic and if left untreated can lead to significant late sequelae including pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal factor infertility. Vaccine development efforts over the past three decades have been unproductive and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans. The existence of serologically distinct strains or serovars of C. trachomatis mandates a vaccine that will provide protection against multiple serovars. Chlamydia spp. use a highly conserved type III secretion system (T3SS) composed of both structural and effector proteins which is an essential virulence factor for infection and intracellular replication. In this study we evaluated a novel fusion protein antigen (BD584) which consists of three T3SS proteins from C. trachomatis (CopB, CopD, and CT584) as a potential chlamydial vaccine candidate. Intranasal immunization with BD584 elicited serum neutralizing antibodies that inhibited C. trachomatis infection in vitro. Following intravaginal challenge with C. muridarum, immunized mice had a 95% reduction in chlamydial shedding from the vagina at the peak of infection and cleared the infection sooner than control mice. Immunization with BD584 also reduced the rate of hydrosalpinx by 87.5% compared to control mice. Together, these results suggest that highly conserved proteins of the chlamydial T3SS may represent good candidates for a Chlamydia vaccine."

0,Dissemination of Chlamydia from the reproductive tract to the gastro-intestinal tract occurs in stages and relies on Chlamydia transport by host cells,10.1371/journal.ppat.1008207,"Chlamydia trachomatis is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen and a major cause of sexually transmitted disease and preventable blindness. In women, infections with C. trachomatis may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. In addition to infecting the female reproductive tract (FRT), Chlamydia spp. are routinely found in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract of animals and humans and can be a reservoir for reinfection of the FRT. Whether Chlamydia disseminates from the FRT to the GI tract via internal routes remains unknown. Using mouse-specific C. muridarum as a model pathogen we show that Chlamydia disseminates from the FRT to the GI tract in a stepwise manner, by first infecting the FRT-draining iliac lymph nodes (ILNs), then the spleen, then the GI tract. Tissue CD11c+ DCs mediate the first step: FRT to ILN Chlamydia transport, which relies on CCR7:CCL21/CCL19 signaling. The second step, Chlamydia transport from ILN to the spleen, also relies on cell transport. However, this step is dependent on cell migration mediated by sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling. Finally, spleen to GI tract Chlamydia spread is the third critical step, and is significantly hindered in splenectomized mice. Inhibition of Chlamydia dissemination significantly reduces or precludes the induction of Chlamydia-specific serum IgG antibodies, presence of which is correlated with FRT pathology in women. This study reveals important insights in context of Chlamydia spp. pathogenesis and will inform the development of therapeutic targets and vaccines to combat this pathogen."
1,"Chlamydia trachomatis infections: screening, diagnosis, and management",,"Chlamydia trachomatis is a gram-negative bacterium that infects the columnar epithelium of the cervix, urethra, and rectum, as well as nongenital sites such as the lungs and eyes. The bacterium is the cause of the most frequently reported sexually transmitted disease in the United States, which is responsible for more than 1 million infections annually. Most persons with this infection are asymptomatic. Untreated infection can result in serious complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy in women, and epididymitis and orchitis in men. Men and women can experience chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis. Treatment of uncomplicated cases should include azithromycin or doxycycline. Screening is recommended in all women younger than 25 years, in all pregnant women, and in women who are at increased risk of infection. Screening is not currently recommended in men. In neonates and infants, the bacterium can cause conjunctivitis and pneumonia. Adults may also experience conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia. Trachoma is a recurrent ocular infection caused by chlamydia and is endemic in the developing world."

Laboratory diagnosis, which is vital for early and appropriate treatment, remains a challenge in resource-limited settings. Our study was undertaken to detect C. trachomatis in women with clinical features of PID. Three endocervical swabs, each obtained from 100 women clinically diagnosed with PID, were subjected to C. trachomatis antigen detection, microscopy and bacteriological culture. Logistic regression was used to assess the risk factors associated with PID. C. trachomatis antigen was present in 6%. The use of hormonal contraception, previous history of PID and a smoking habit were found to have statistically significant association in those who tested positive. Adjunctive use of rapid Chlamydia antigen test with a routinely practiced syndromic approach is beneficial for timely and appropriate antimicrobial therapy in women with PID."
0,Chlamydia trachomatis: the Persistent Pathogen,10.1128/CVI.00203-17,"Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium whose only natural host is humans. Although presenting as asymptomatic in most women, genital tract chlamydial infections are a leading cause of pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal factor infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. C. trachomatis has evolved successful mechanisms to avoid destruction by autophagy and the host immune system and persist within host epithelial cells. The intracellular form of this organism, the reticulate body, can enter into a persistent nonreplicative but viable state under unfavorable conditions. The infectious form of the organism, the elementary body, is again generated when the immune attack subsides. In its persistent form, C. trachomatis ceases to produce its major structural and membrane components, but synthesis of its 60-kDa heat shock protein (hsp60) is greatly upregulated and released from the cell. The immune response to hsp60, perhaps exacerbated by repeated cycles of productive infection and persistence, may promote damage to fallopian tube epithelial cells, scar formation, and tubal occlusion. The chlamydial and human hsp60 proteins are very similar, and hsp60 is one of the first proteins produced by newly formed embryos. Thus, the development of immunity to epitopes in the chlamydial hsp60 that are also present in the corresponding human hsp60 may increase susceptibility to pregnancy failure in infected women. Delineation of host factors that increase the likelihood that C. trachomatis will avoid immune destruction and survive within host epithelial cells and utilization of this knowledge to design individualized preventative and treatment protocols are needed to more effectively combat infections by this persistent pathogen."
0,Antibodies to Variable Domain 4 Linear Epitopes of the Chlamydia trachomatis Major Outer Membrane Protein Are Not Associated with Chlamydia Resolution or Reinfection in Women,10.1128/mSphere.00654-20,"Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium. C. trachomatis infection is the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection and can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women. There is no licensed vaccine for C. trachomatis prevention, in part due to gaps in our knowledge of C. trachomatis-specific immune responses elicited during human infections. Previous investigations of the antibody response to C. trachomatis have identified immunodominant antigens and antibodies that can neutralize infection in cell culture. However, epitope-specific responses to C. trachomatis are not well characterized, and the impact of these antibodies on infection outcome is unknown. We recently developed a technology called deep sequence-coupled biopanning that uses bacteriophage virus-like particles to display peptides from antigens and affinity select against human serum IgG. Here, we used this technology to map C. trachomatis-specific antibodies in groups of women with defined outcomes following C. trachomatis infection: (i) C. trachomatis negative upon presentation for treatment (""spontaneous resolvers""), (ii) C. trachomatis negative at a 3-month follow-up visit after treatment (""nonreinfected""), and (iii) C. trachomatis positive at a 3-month follow-up after treatment (""reinfected""). This analysis yielded immunodominant epitopes that had been previously described but also identified new epitopes targeted by human antibody responses to C. trachomatis We focused on human antibody responses to the C. trachomatis variable domain 4 serovar-conserved region of the major outer membrane protein (VD4-MOMP), a previously described immunodominant epitope. All three groups of women produced IgG to the VD4-MOMP, suggesting that detection of serum antibodies to VD4-MOMP in women with urogenital C. trachomatis infection is not associated with protection against reinfection.IMPORTANCEC. trachomatis infection is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection, and infection in women can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. No licensed vaccine exists to prevent C. trachomatis infection, and investigations of the natural immune response may inform the design of targeted vaccines for C. trachomatis Our study fills a gap in knowledge regarding the epitope specificity of antibody responses that are elicited in response to C. trachomatis infection in women. We identified several new B cell epitopes for C. trachomatis antigens and confirmed B cell epitopes that have been identified by other methods. Our finding that women produce antibodies to the VD4-MOMP regardless of infection outcome provides insight into vaccine development, suggesting that vaccines targeting VD4-MOMP may need to elicit higher-titer antibody responses than natural infection imparts or that additional vaccine targets should be pursued in the future."
0,Chlamydia-Specific IgA Secretion in the Female Reproductive Tract Induced via Per-Oral Immunization Confers Protection against Primary Chlamydia Challenge,10.1128/IAI.00413-20,"Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen that causes sexually transmitted disease. In women, chlamydial infections may cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. The role of antibodies in protection against a primary Chlamydia infection is unclear and was a focus of this work. Using the C. muridarum mouse infection model, we show that intestinal mucosa is infected via intranasal (i.n.) or per-oral (p.o.) Chlamydia inoculation and that unlike the female reproductive tract (FRT) mucosa, it halts systemic Chlamydia dissemination. Moreover, p.o. immunization or infection with Chlamydia confers protection against per-vaginal (p.v.) challenge, resulting in significantly decreased bacterial burden in the FRT, accelerated Chlamydia clearance, and reduced hydrosalpinx pathology. In contrast, subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization conferred no protection against the p.v. challenge. Both p.o. and s.c. immunizations induced Chlamydia-specific serum IgA. However, IgA was found only in the vaginal washes and fecal extracts of p.o.-immunized animals. Following a p.v. challenge, unimmunized control and s.c.-s.c.-immunized animals developed Chlamydia-specific intestinal IgA yet failed to develop IgA in the FRT, indicating that IgA response in the FRT relies on the FRT to gastrointestinal tract (GIT) antigen transport. Vaginal secretions of p.o.-immunized animals neutralize Chlamydia in vivo, resulting in significantly lower Chlamydia burden in the FRT and Chlamydia transport to the GIT. We also show that infection of the GIT is not necessary for induction of protective immunity in the FRT, a finding that is important for the development of p.o. subunit vaccines to target Chlamydia and possibly other sexually transmitted pathogens."
0,Resolution of Chlamydia trachomatis Infection Is Associated with a Distinct T Cell Response Profile,10.1128/CVI.00247-15,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the causative agent of the most frequently reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection, the total burden of which is underestimated due to the asymptomatic nature of the infection. Untreated C. trachomatis infections can cause significant morbidities, including pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal factor infertility (TFI). The human immune response against C. trachomatis, an obligate intracellular bacterium, is poorly characterized but is thought to rely on cell-mediated immunity, with CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells implicated in protection. In this report, we present immune profiling data of subjects enrolled in a multicenter study of C. trachomatis genital infection. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from subjects grouped into disease-specific cohorts were screened using a C. trachomatis proteomic library to identify the antigen specificities of recall T cell responses after natural exposure by measuring interferon gamma (IFN-γ) levels. We identified specific T cell responses associated with the resolution of infection, including unique antigens identified in subjects who spontaneously cleared infection and different antigens associated with C. trachomatis-related sequelae, such as TFI. These data suggest that novel and unique C. trachomatis T cell antigens identified in individuals with effective immune responses can be considered as targets for vaccine development, and by excluding antigens associated with deleterious sequelae, immune-mediated pathologies may be circumvented."

This Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium, which often causes asymptomatic infection, may cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancies, scarring of the fallopian tubes, miscarriage, and infertility when left untreated. In the genital tract, Chlamydia trachomatis infects primarily epithelial cells and requires Th1 immunity for optimal clearance. This review first focuses on the immune cells important in a chlamydial infection. Second, we summarize the research and challenges associated with developing a chlamydial vaccine that elicits a protective Th1-mediated immune response without inducing adverse immunopathologies."
0,Comparison of Murine Cervicovaginal Infection by Chlamydial Strains: Identification of Extrusions Shed In vivo,10.3389/fcimb.2017.00018,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and preventable blindness. Untreated, asymptomatic infection as well as frequent re-infection are common and may drive pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. In vivo models of chlamydial infection continue to be instrumental in progress toward a vaccine and further elucidating the pathogenesis of this intracellular bacterium, however significant gaps in our understanding remain. Chlamydial host cell exit occurs via two mechanisms, lysis and extrusion, although the latter has yet to be reported in vivo and its biological role is unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate whether chlamydial extrusions are shed in vivo following infection with multiple strains of Chlamydia. We utilized an established C3H/HeJ murine cervicovaginal infection model with C. trachomatis serovars D and L2 and the Chlamydia muridarum strain MoPn to monitor the (i) time course of infection and mode of host cell exit, (ii) mucosal and systemic immune response to infection, and (iii) gross and histopathology following clearance of active infection. The key finding herein is the first identification of chlamydial extrusions shed from host cells in an in vivo model. Extrusions, a recently appreciated mode of host cell exit and potential means of dissemination, had been previously observed solely in vitro. The results of this study demonstrate that chlamydial extrusions exist in vivo and thus warrant further investigation to determine their role in chlamydial pathogenesis."
0,Capsid protein Vp1 from chlamydiaphage φCPG1 effectively alleviates cytotoxicity induced by Chlamydia trachomatis,10.3892/etm.2018.6629,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of sexually transmitted bacterial infections. C. trachomatis genital infection may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and tubal infertility, which are major public health problems. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of this bacterium remain unclear, and the efficacy of clinical therapeutics is unsatisfactory. In the current study, whether Vp1 can alleviate the cytotoxicity induced by Chlamydia trachomatis infection was investigated. C. trachomatis was pre-treated with BSA or purified Vp1 protein and used to infect HeLa cells. It was observed that Vp1 significantly inhibited the infectivity of C. trachomatis in cell cultures. In addition, the Vp1 pretreatment reduced the chlamydial Hsp60 protein levels and decreased the C. trachomatis inclusion number. The Vp1 pretreatment also prevented C. trachomatis-induced cytotoxicity in host cells. Furthermore, the chlamydial suppression of host cell proapoptotic p53 protein and the induction of antiapoptotic cIAP-2 and Mcl-1 gene expression were reversed by the Vp1 pretreatment. These observations suggest that Vp1 has a clear inhibitory effect on C. trachomatis growth in vitro."
0,Endocervical miRNA Expression Profiles in Women Positive for Chlamydia trachomatis with Clinical Signs and/or Symptoms Are Distinct from Those in Women Positive for Chlamydia trachomatis without Signs and Symptoms,10.1128/IAI.00057-20,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of sexually transmitted infections that may progress to pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. No effective vaccine exists for Chlamydia, nor are there biomarkers available that readily predict disease progression. In this cross-sectional pilot study, we recruited symptomatic and asymptomatic women with C. trachomatis (CT) infection and asymptomatic, uninfected control women from an urban sexually transmitted disease clinic to determine if there were differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression. Infected women with signs and/or symptoms (CTSS) have distinct miRNA profiles compared to asymptomatic infected women (CTNS). In the CTSS group, miR-142 and -147 showed 2.2- to 6.9-fold increases in expression. In the CTNS group, miR-449c, -6779, -519d, -449a, and -2467 showed 3.9- to 9.0-fold increases in expression. In the CTNS group, cyclins and cell cycle regulation and IL-17 pathways were likely downregulated, while the same signaling pathways were upregulated in the CTSS group. In addition, in the CTSS group, additional inflammatory pathways associated with TNFR1 and IL-8 appear to be upregulated. The miRNA expression patterns differ between CT-infected symptomatic and asymptomatic women, and these differences may warrant further study."
0,Erroneously Suspected Ovarian Cancer in a 38-Year-Old Woman with Pelvic Inflammatory Disease and Chlamydia,10.1155/2017/2514613,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial cause of sexually transmitted disease and can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), leading to severe outcomes such as ectopic pregnancy, infertility, or pelvic pain. We report a case of a 38-year-old patient with abdominal pain and dyspareunia. Clinical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness. Vaginal and abdominal sonography showed substantial ascites and CA-125 level was elevated. Therefore, the attendant physician performed an abdominal CT scan for further diagnosis. Radiographically diffuse peritoneal enhancement, consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis, 4-quadrant ascites, and slightly enlarged ovaries with solid and cystic structures were diagnosed, leading to the suspicion of ovarian cancer. In addition, the results of the cervical smear PCR for chlamydia were positive. Due to the positive chlamydia result, the suspicious CT scan, and the young age, we decided to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy as a first step. Intraoperatively, the ovaries were of normal aspect without any cancerous lesions. However, the ascites and the yellow-reddish jelly-like deposits were consistent with acute PID. Thus, chlamydia infection may simulate the presentation of ovarian cancer. Therefore, especially in young patients, we recommend careful scrutiny of every diagnosis of ovarian cancer even if its presentation seems to be typical."
0,Intranasal vaccination with Chlamydia pneumoniae induces cross-species immunity against genital Chlamydia muridarum challenge in mice,10.1371/journal.pone.0064917,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the world and specifically in the United States, with the highest incidence in age-groups 14-19 years. In a subset of females, the C. trachomatis genital infection leads to serious pathological sequelae including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Chlamydia pneumoniae, another member of the same genus, is a common cause of community acquired respiratory infection with significant number of children aged 5-14 yr displaying sero-conversion. Since these bacteriae share several antigenic determinants, we evaluated whether intranasal immunization with live C. pneumoniae (1×10(6) inclusion forming units; IFU) in 5 week old female C57BL/6 mice would induce cross-species protection against subsequent intravaginal challenge with Chlamydia muridarum (5×10(4) IFU), which causes a similar genital infection and pathology in mice as C. trachomatis in humans. Mice vaccinated intranasally with live C. pneumoniae, but not mock (PBS) immunized animals, displayed high levels of splenic cellular antigen-specific IFN-γ production and serum antibody response against C. muridarum and C. trachomatis. Mice vaccinated with C. pneumoniae displayed a significant reduction in the vaginal C. muridarum shedding as early as day 12 after secondary i.vag. challenge compared to PBS (mock) immunized mice. At day 19 after C. muridarum challenge, 100% of C. pneumoniae vaccinated mice had cleared the infection compared to none (0%) of the mock immunized mice, which cleared the infection by day 27. At day 80 after C. muridarum challenge, C. pneumoniae vaccinated mice displayed a significant reduction in the incidence (50%) and degree of hydrosalpinx compared to mock immunized animals (100%). These results suggest that respiratory C. pneumoniae infection induces accelerated chlamydial clearance and reduction of oviduct pathology following genital C. muridarum challenge, and may have important implications to the C. trachomatis-induced reproductive disease in humans."
1,Genital Chlamydia trachomatis: an update,,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of curable bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. It manifests primarily as urethritis in males and endocervicitis in females. Untreated chlamydial infection in man can cause epididymitis and proctitis. Though most women with Chlamydia infection are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms, some develop salpingitis, endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility. It is associated with an increased risk for the transmission or acquisition of HIV and is also attributed to be a risk factor for the development of cervical carcinoma. Early diagnosis and treatment of infected individuals is required to prevent the spread of the disease and severe sequelae. Traditionally, tissue culture was considered the gold standard for the diagnosis. However, with the availability of newer diagnostic techniques particularly molecular methods which are not only highly sensitive and specific but are cost-effective also, the diagnosis has became fast and easy. The purpose of this review is to study the various aspects of genital C. trachomatis infection. Also the advances related to the clinical picture, various diagnostic modalities, prevention, treatment, drug resistance and control measures will be dealt with."
0,Chlamydia trachomatis: Protective Adaptive Responses and Prospects for a Vaccine,10.1007/82_2016_6,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of sexually transmitted bacterial infection globally. These infections translate to a significant public health burden, particularly women's healthcare costs due to serious disease sequelae such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubal factor infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy. There is no evidence that natural immunity can provide complete, long-term protection necessary to prevent chronic pathology, making human vaccine development critical. Vaccine design will require careful consideration of protective versus pathological host-response mechanisms in concert with elucidation of optimal antigens and adjuvants. Evidence suggests that a Th1 response, facilitated by IFN-γ-producing CD4 T cells, will be instrumental in generating long-term, sterilizing immunity. Although the role of antibodies is not completely understood, they have exhibited a protective effect by enhancing chlamydial clearance. Future work will require investigation of broadly neutralizing antibodies and antibody-augmented cellular immunity to successfully design a vaccine that potently elicits both arms of the immune response. Sterilizing immunity is the ultimate goal. However, vaccine-induced partial immunity that prevents upper genital tract infection and inflammation would be cost-effective compared to current screening and treatment strategies. In this chapter, we examine evidence from animal and human studies demonstrating protective adaptive immune responses to Chlamydia and discuss future challenges and prospects for vaccine development."
0,Prophylactic Multi-Subunit Vaccine against Chlamydia trachomatis: In Vivo Evaluation in Mice,10.3390/vaccines9060609,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most frequent sexually-transmitted disease-causing bacterium. Urogenital serovars of this intracellular pathogen lead to urethritis and cervicitis. Ascending infections result in pelvic inflammatory disease, salpingitis, and oophoritis. One of 200 urogenital infections leads to tubal infertility. Serovars A-C cause trachoma with visual impairment. There is an urgent need for a vaccine. We characterized a new five-component subunit vaccine in a mouse vaccination-lung challenge infection model. Four recombinant Pmp family-members and Ctad1 from C. trachomatis serovar E, all of which participate in adhesion and binding of chlamydial elementary bodies to host cells, were combined with the mucosal adjuvant cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate. Intranasal application led to a high degree of cross-serovar protection against urogenital and ocular strains of C. trachomatis, which lasted at least five months. Critical evaluated parameters were body weight, clinical score, chlamydial load, a granulocyte marker and the cytokines IFN-γ/TNF-α in lung homogenate. Vaccine antigen-specific antibodies and a mixed Th1/Th2/Th17 T cell response with multi-functional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells correlate with protection. However, serum-transfer did not protect the recipients suggesting that circulating antibodies play only a minor role. In the long run, our new vaccine might help to prevent the feared consequences of human C. trachomatis infections."
1,"Chlamydia trachomatis as the Cause of Infectious Infertility: Acute, Repetitive or Persistent Long-Term Infection?",10.1007/82_2016_15,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most frequently detected agent of sexually transmitted infections worldwide. Infection of the lower female genital tract (FGT) can cause cervicitis and if ascending to the upper FGT may result in serious sequelae such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), salpingitis and tubal factor infertility (TFI). The factors leading to this complication are still not completely understood. We elaborate four different models for host-pathogen interactions in C. trachomatis infections that may promote disease development: (1) acute infection, (2) repeated infections, (3) chronic/persistent infections and (4) non-inflammatory colonization. Whereas experimental data exist for all of these models in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, we were interested in seeing what clinical evidence we have supporting one or the other model. We particularly focused on data that favour the one or the other model for TFI development in C. trachomatis infection and speculate on future studies that could integrate in vitro findings for a better characterization of the situation in vivo."

This obligate intracellular pathogen is known to cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and chronic infections resulting in tubal factor infertility and ectopic pregnancy. However, the majority of the infections remains asymptomatic and thus untreated. For this reason, the ultimate goal for the prevention C. trachomatis infections is an effective vaccine. Here we review the major challenges and the different strategies associated with the development of an anti-Chlamydial vaccine. Even if an effective vaccine is not available yet, recent advances in the understanding of C. trachomatis pathogenesis and mucosal immune system are promising for its future development."
0,A renewed tool kit to explore Chlamydia pathogenesis: from molecular genetics to new infection models,10.12688/f1000research.18832.1,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen and the leading cause of preventable blindness in the developing world. C. trachomatis invades the epithelium of the conjunctiva and genital tract and replicates within an intracellular membrane-bound compartment termed the inclusion. To invade and replicate in mammalian cells, Chlamydia remodels epithelial surfaces by reorganizing the cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesions, reprograms membrane trafficking, and modulates cell signaling to dampen innate immune responses. If the infection ascends to the upper female genital tract, it can result in pelvic inflammatory disease and tissue scarring. C. trachomatis infections are associated with infertility, ectopic pregnancies, the fibrotic disorder endometriosis, and potentially cancers of the cervix and uterus. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms by which this clinically important human pathogen subverts host cellular functions and causes disease have remained relatively poorly understood because of the dearth of molecular genetic tools to study Chlamydiae and limitations of both in vivo and in vitro infection models. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the experimental molecular tool kit available to dissect C. trachomatis infections with a special focus on Chlamydia-induced epithelial barrier disruption by regulating the structure, function, and dynamics of epithelial cell-cell junctions."
0,Vaccination with the polymorphic membrane protein A reduces Chlamydia muridarum induced genital tract pathology,10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.04.017,"Chlamydia trachomatis serovars D-K are one of the most frequent causes of sexually transmitted infections of the female genital tract, with possible complications such as hydrosalpinx, pelvic inflammatory disease, extra-uterine gravidity or infertility. We used the murine genital tract infection model with C. muridarum for vaccination studies and found that more than 70% of the infected mice suffered from uterus dilatations and/or hydrosalpinx. Systemic consequences of the vaginal infection were apparent by splenomegaly ten to fifteen days post infection. While cultivable microorganisms were detectable for the first 23days post infection, the first lesions of the genital tract developed at day 15, however, many lesions occurred later in the absence of cultivable bacteria. Lesions were not accompanied by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFNɣ, TNF and IL-6, since these cytokines were almost undetectable in the genital tract 43days post infection. To prevent genital tract lesions, we vaccinated mice with the polymorphic membrane protein (Pmp) A in combination with CpG-ODN 1826 as adjuvant. The vaccine lowered the chlamydial burden and the differences were significant at day 10 post infection but not later. More importantly the vaccine decreased the rate and severity of genital tract lesions. Interestingly, control vaccination with the protein ovalbumin plus CpG-ODN 1826 enhanced significantly the severity but not the rate of pathologic lesions, which was presumably caused by the activation of innate immune responses by the adjuvant in the absence of a C. muridarum-specific adaptive immune response. In summary, vaccination with recombinant PmpA plus CpG-ODN 1826 significantly reduced C. muridarum-induced tissue damage, however, CpG-ODN 1826 may aggravate C. muridarum-induced tissue injuries in the absence of a protective antigen."
0,The role of an enzymatically inactive CPAF mutant vaccination in Chlamydia muridarum genital tract infection,10.1016/j.micpath.2021.105137,"Chlamydia trachomatis urogenital tract infection causes pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility, increases the risk of co-infection with HPV and HIV. Chlamydial vaccination is considered the most promising approach to prevent and control its infection. Among various chlamydial vaccine candidates, chlamydial protease-like activity factor (CPAF) have been reported to provide robust protective immunity against genital chlamydial infection in mice with reduced vaginal shedding and oviduct pathology. However, CPAF is a serine protease which has enzymatical activity to degrade a large number of substrates. In order to increase the safety of CPAF vaccine, in this study, we used a mutant CPAF that is deficient in enzymatical activity to determine whether proteolytic activity of CPAF affect its vaccine efficacy. The wild type or mutant CPAF immunization causes a significant lower chlamydial shedding from the vaginal and resolve the infection as early as day 20, compared to day 28 in adjuvant control mice. More important, reduced upper reproductive tract pathology were also observed in these two groups. The mutant or wild type CPAF immunization induced not only robust splenic IFN-γ and serum IgG2a but also sIgA secretion in the vaginal fluids. Furthermore, neutralization of chlamydia with immune sera did not provide protection against oviduct pathology. However, adoptive transfer of CD4+ splenocytes isolated from the mutant or wild type CPAF immunized mice resulted in a significant and comparable reduced oviduct pathology. Our results indicate mutant CPAF vaccination is as same efficacy as wild type, and the protection relies on CD4+ T cells, which will further promote the development of CPAF as clinical chlamydial vaccine."
0,"Designing a Multi-Epitope Vaccine against Chlamydia trachomatis by Employing Integrated Core Proteomics, Immuno-Informatics and In Silico Approaches",10.3390/biology10100997,"Chlamydia trachomatis, a Gram-negative bacterium that infects the rectum, urethra, congenital sites, and columnar epithelium of the cervix. It is a major cause of preventable blindness, ectopic pregnancy, and bacterial sexually transmitted infections worldwide. There is currently no licensed multi-epitope vaccination available for this pathogen. This study used core proteomics, immuno-informatics, and subtractive proteomics approaches to identify the best antigenic candidates for the development of a multi-epitope-based vaccine (MEBV). These approaches resulted in six vaccine candidates: Type III secretion system translocon subunit CopD2, SctW family type III secretion system gatekeeper subunit CopN, SycD/LcrH family type III secretion system chaperone Scc2, CT847 family type III secretion system effector, hypothetical protein CTDEC_0668, and CHLPN 76kDa-like protein. A variety of immuno-informatics tools were used to predict B and T cell epitopes from vaccine candidate proteins. An in silico vaccine was developed using carefully selected epitopes (11 CTL, 2 HTL & 10 LBL) and then docked with the MHC molecules (MHC I & MHC II) and human TLR4. The vaccine was coupled with Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) adjuvant to boost the immune response. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular docking, and MMGBSA analysis were carried out to analyze the molecular interactions and binding affinity of MEBV with TLR4 and MHC molecules. To achieve the highest level of vaccine protein expression, the MEBV was cloned and reverse-translated in Escherichia coli. The highest level of expression was achieved, and a CAI score of 0.97 was reported. Further experimental validation of the MEBV is required to prove its efficacy. The vaccine developed will be useful in preventing infections caused by C. trachomatis."
0,Effects of Mentha suaveolens essential oil on Chlamydia trachomatis,10.1155/2015/508071,"Chlamydia trachomatis, the most common cause of sexually transmitted bacterial infection worldwide, has a unique biphasic developmental cycle alternating between the infectious elementary body and the replicative reticulate body. C. trachomatis is responsible for severe reproductive complications including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and obstructive infertility. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether Mentha suaveolens essential oil (EOMS) can be considered as a promising candidate for preventing C. trachomatis infection. Specifically, we investigated the in vitro effects of EOMS towards C. trachomatis analysing the different phases of chlamydial developmental cycle. Our results demonstrated that EOMS was effective towards C. trachomatis, whereby it not only inactivated infectious elementary bodies but also inhibited chlamydial replication. Our study also revealed the effectiveness of EOMS, in combination with erythromycin, towards C. trachomatis with a substantial reduction in the minimum effect dose of antibiotic. In conclusion, EOMS treatment may represent a preventative strategy since it may reduce C. trachomatis transmission in the population and, thereby, reduce the number of new chlamydial infections and risk of developing of severe sequelae."
0,Immunopathogenesis of genital Chlamydia infection: insights from mouse models,10.1093/femspd/ftab012,"Chlamydiae are pathogenic intracellular bacteria that cause a wide variety of diseases throughout the globe, affecting the eye, lung, coronary arteries and female genital tract. Rather than by direct cellular toxicity, Chlamydia infection generally causes pathology by inducing fibrosis and scarring that is largely mediated by host inflammation. While a robust immune response is required for clearance of the infection, certain elements of that immune response may also damage infected tissue, leading to, in the case of female genital infection, disease sequelae such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and ectopic pregnancy. It has become increasingly clear that the components of the immune system that destroy bacteria and those that cause pathology only partially overlap. In the ongoing quest for a vaccine that prevents Chlamydia-induced disease, it is important to target mechanisms that can achieve protective immunity while preventing mechanisms that damage tissue. This review focuses on mouse models of genital Chlamydia infection and synthesizes recent studies to generate a comprehensive model for immunity in the murine female genital tract, clarifying the respective contributions of various branches of innate and adaptive immunity to both host protection and pathogenic genital scarring."
0,Potential impact of vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis on Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the United States: results from a decision-analysis model,10.4161/hv.36221,"Components in 4CMenB vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B have shown to potentially cross-react with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We modeled the theoretical impact of a US 4CMenB vaccination program on gonorrhea outcomes. A decision-analysis model was populated using published healthcare utilization and cost data. A two-dose adolescent vaccination campaign was assumed, with protective immunity starting at age 15 years and a base-case efficacy against gonorrhea of 20%. The 20%-efficacy level is an assumption since no clinical data have yet quantified the efficacy of 4CMenB against Neisseria gonorrhoea. Key outcome measures were reductions in gonorrhea and HIV infections, reduction in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost, and the economically justifiable price assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $75,000 per QALY gained. Adolescent vaccination with 4CMenB would prevent 83,167 (95% credible interval [CrI], 44,600-134,600) gonorrhea infections and decrease the number of HIV infections by 55 (95% CrI, 2-129) per vaccinated birth cohort in the USA. Excluding vaccination costs, direct medical costs for gonorrhea would reduce by $28.7 million (95% CrI, $6.8-$70.0 million), and income and productivity losses would reduce by $40.0 million (95% CrI, $8.2-$91.7 million). Approximately 83% of the reduction in lost productivity is generated by avoiding HIV infections. At a cost of $75,000 per QALY gained, and incremental to the vaccine's effect on meningococcal disease, a price of $26.10 (95% CrI, $9.10-$57.20) per dose, incremental to the price of the meningococcal vaccine, would be justified from the societal perspective. At this price, the net cost per infection averted would be $1,677 (95% CrI, $404-$2,564). Even if the cross-immunity of 4CMenB vaccine and gonorrhea is only 20%, the reduction in gonorrhea infections and associated costs would be substantial."
0,Assessing the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis genome in pregnant women with spontaneous abortion using polymerase chain reaction method in Yasuj: First report from Southwest of Iran,10.4103/jehp.jehp_6_17,"CONTEXT: Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the most prevalent factors of sexually transmitted diseases worldwide, which causes abortion, premature rupture of membrane, uterine cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory diseases, and ectopic pregnancy. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of C. trachomatis genome in pregnant women with abortion in Yasuj, Iran. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This is a descriptive-analytical study in Shahid Mofateh Gyneco-obstetrics clinic and Emam sajjad Hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Specimens of cervix, urine, placenta, and blood of 107 pregnant women were simultaneously collected at maternity ward and operation room and were stored for molecular tests. The molecular tests were performed, and the results were analyzed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Analysis was performed using SPSS software 9.1 (IBM, Illinois, Chicago, USA) with descriptive-analytical statistics. RESULTS: Of 107 women, 15 had polymerase chain reaction-positive tests for C. trachomatis. The age of the studied individuals was 15-38 years with mean age of 26.6 years. The highest infection rates were in the age group of 21-25 years (7.47%), and the lowest frequency was in the age group of 36-40 years. A significant difference was noted between the number of first abortions in the case and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that C. trachomatis as a sexually transmitted agent causes severe complications such as abortion; thus, it is important to screen pregnant and sexually active women who are craving to carry a baby."
0,Human papillomavirus and Chlamydia trachomatis infection in gyneco-obstetric outpatients from a mexican hospital,10.4103/ijmm.IJMM_15_450,"CONTEXT: Human papillomavirus (HPV) and Chlamydia trachomatis are the most frequent sexually transmitted infections, usually asymptomatic. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV types and other cofactors such as the concomitant infection with C. trachomatis can represent a higher risk to develop cervical lesions; therefore, screening with sensitive methods could aid to identify women at risk. AIMS: The aim is to determine the prevalence and concurrence of both infections, detected with in-house molecular methods, and to identify the risk factors associated to the infections in Mexican women. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study including gynaecological-obstetrical medical outpatients from a Social Security Hospital in Southeast Mexico. After informed consent, cervicovaginal samples were collected and tested for HPV and C. trachomatis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HPV positives were further tested for high-risk HPV16, 18, 58 and low-risk 11 using real-time PCR. All methods employed were in-house. Data analyses included odds ratios (OR), Chi-square and linear regressions. RESULTS: Women included were 233, aging 15-49 (mean 30 years), 52.8% were pregnant. For HPV and C. trachomatis testing, 230 samples were adequate, resulting in 48 (20.9%) and 15 (6.5%) positives, respectively; 4 (1.7%) were positive to both. The most frequent genotype identified was HPV58 (25% of typified samples). C. trachomatis positives were 73% asymptomatic, none had pelvic inflammatory disease or infertility histories. The only variable associated to HPV infection was the history of previous sexually transmitted disease (OR = 3.69,P= 0.0019). CONCLUSIONS: More than 25% of the population was infected with either agent. We successfully used in-house molecular methodologies for diagnosis and typing, showing HPV and C. trachomatis prevalence consistent to previous reports. Concomitant infections were found, HPV high-risk types were involved in half of these cases, representing a higher risk."

However, coverage may be inadequate for Mycoplasma genitalium (MG)/Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infections. We compared the longitudinal MG and TV outcomes with NG/CT outcomes for women enrolled in a longitudinal randomized controlled trial to optimize outcomes after PID. The prevalences of CT and NG were lower at 30- and 90-day follow-up compared with the prevalence at the time of diagnosis. No significant difference was observed for MG (odds ratio, 0.95; 0.86-1.04; P = 0.265) and TV (odds ratio, 0.89; 0.75-1.04; P = 0.146) over time for both treatment groups, showing that persistence and/or reinfection with MG and TV occurs more frequently than with CT or NG after treatment of PID using current national treatment guidelines."
0,Chronic scrotal pain syndrome (CSPS): the widespread use of antibiotics is not justified,10.1111/j.2047-2927.2012.00017.x,"Data supporting the widespread use of antibiotics in patients with chronic scrotal pain syndrome (CSPS) are not available. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of bacteria in the genitourinary tract in patients presenting with CSPS. From July 2005 to July 2007 we prospectively enrolled patients presenting with CSPS in our outpatient clinic. The evaluation consisted of a detailed patient's history, physical examination and ultrasound examination of the scrotum. A blood and urinalysis, a Meares-Stamey four-glass test for bacterial cultures and PCR testing for Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae as well as a semen culture were performed. We assessed the symptom severity with the chronic epididymitis symptom index (CESI) score according to Nickel et al. (J Urol 2002, 167:1701; based on the NIH-CPSI). A total of 55 eligible men (median age 34 years) with CSPS were enrolled in the study. The median CESI score was 17 (range 4-26). The majority of patients (n = 39; 71%) were seen by a general practitioner or an urologist before. Of these, 25 patients (64%) were treated with antibiotics and 26 (67%) with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, respectively. A significant bacterial colony count in at least one specimen was detected in 21 of 55 patients (38%). The predominantly detected microorganisms were an Alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus (11 patients) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (10 patients). Thus, only in 12 of 55 (22%) patients isolated bacteria were considered to be of clinical relevance. No factor or condition predictive for a bacterial aetiology for CSPS could be identified. In our microbiological assessment of patients presenting with CSPS we found no evidence for the widely held belief that CSPS is predominantly the result of a chronic bacterial infection. We therefore conclude that the widespread use of antibiotic agents in the treatment of patients with CSPS is not justified."
1,"An update on prevalence, diagnosis, treatment and emerging issues of genital mycoplasma infection in Indian women: A narrative review",10.4103/ijdvl.IJDVL_915_18,"Despite adequate treatment of reproductive tract infection, there is persistence of symptoms in some patients. This raises the possibility of existence of other silent microbes with pathogenic potential. Apart from the common sexually transmitted organisms such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, there are other silent and emerging pathogens, like genital mycoplasma, which have been associated with cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and pregnancy-related complications in women. Although these organisms were identified decades ago, they are still overlooked or ignored. There is a need to understand the role played by these organisms in Asian populations and their susceptibility to the standard line of treatment. Data on genital mycoplasma infections in Indian women is heterogeneous, with limited evidence of pathogenicity. Although known for their wide spectrum of reproductive morbidities in western counterparts, these microorganisms are yet to gain the attention of Indian clinicians and microbiologists. There is paucity of adequate information in India regarding these infections, so Indian literature was compiled to get an overview of these pathogens, their association with reproductive morbidities, and their response to treatment. Thus, there is a need to explore genital mycoplasma infections in Indian women, especially in the arena of antimicrobial resistance among genital mycoplasma, which has the potential to become a major problem. A literature search with keywords focusing on ""genital mycoplasma"", ""sexually transmitted infections India"", ""sexually transmitted mycoplasma"", and ""characteristic of mycoplasma"" was carried out through computerized databases like PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar."
0,Highlighting the clinical need for diagnosing Mycoplasma genitalium infection,10.1177/0956462417753527,"Despite Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) being increasingly recognised as a genital pathogen in men and women, awareness and utility of commercially available MG-testing has been low. The opinion of UK sexual health clinicians and allied professionals was sought on how MG-testing should be used. Thirty-two consensus statements were developed by an expert group and circulated to clinicians and laboratory staff, who were asked to evaluate their level of agreement with each statement; 75% agreement was set as the threshold for defining consensus for each statement. A modified Delphi approach was used and high levels of agreement obviated the need to test the original statement set further. Of 201 individuals who received questionnaires, 60 responded, most (48) being sexual health consultants, more than 10% of the total in the UK. Twenty-seven (84.4%) of the statements exceeded the 75% threshold. Respondents strongly supported MG-testing of patients with urethritis, pelvic inflammatory disease or unexplained persistent vaginal discharge, or post-coital bleeding. Fewer favoured testing patients with proctitis and support was divided for routinely testing Chlamydia-positive patients. Testing of current sexual contacts of MG-positive patients was supported, as was a test of cure for MG-positive patients, although agreement fell below the 75% threshold. Respondents agreed that all consultant- or specialist-led services should have access to testing for MG (98.3%). There was strong agreement for having MG-testing available for specific patient groups, which may reflect concern over antibiotic resistance and the desire to comply with clinical guidelines that recommend MG-testing in sexual health clinic settings."

While it remains an uncommon disease, the prevalence is climbing steadily. Among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults, especially men who have sex with men, ASCC is one of the more common non-AIDS-defining malignancies. The precursor lesion, anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), is prevalent in the HIV-infected population. More than 90% of ASCCs are related to human papilloma virus (HPV), oncogenic types (HPV 16, 18). While the biology of HPV-related intraepithelial neoplasia is consistent in the anogenital area, the natural history of AIN is poorly understood and is not identical to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). CIN is also considered an AIDS-defining malignancy, and the methods for screening and prevention of AIN are derived from the CIN literature. This article will discuss the epidemiology of ASCC and its association with HPV and the life cycle of the HPV, and the molecular changes that lead to clearance, productive infection, latency, and persistence. The immunology of HPV infection will discuss natural immunity, humoral and cellular immunity, and how the HPV virus evades and interferes with these mechanisms. We will also discuss high-risk factors for developing AIN in high-risk patient populations with relation to infections (HIV, HPV, and chlamydia infections), prolonged immunocompromised people, and sexual behavior and tobacco abuse. We will also discuss the pre- and post-HAART era and its effect on AINs and ASCC. Finally, we will discuss the importance of anal cytology and high-resolution anoscopy with and without biopsy in this high-risk population."
0,Multipeptide Assays for Sensitive and Differential Detection of Anti-Chlamydia Trachomatis Antibodies,10.1093/infdis/jiab016,"Detection of anti-Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) antibodies is compromised by cross-reactivity and poor sensitivity of classic Ctr-antigens. We discovered 48 strongly reactive peptide antigens of Ctr-specific B-cell epitopes from 21 immunodominant proteins. In this study, we review the utility of peptide assays for diagnosis of Ctr infections. By combining many of these Ctr-specific B-cell epitopes from several proteins in separate or mixed multipeptide assays, they achieved vastly superior assay sensitivity and specificity over standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Such multipeptide assays eliminate cross-reactivities (false positives) and correct for stochastic gaps in antibody responses (false negatives). More importantly, we developed and validated a novel microarray platform in which hundreds of peptides from many proteins are spotted in a single reaction well. This offers the possibility of high-throughput screening of many candidate peptides for routine serological fingerprinting of Ctr infections. Discovery of optimal sets of antibody responses that associate with clinical pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) may identify diagnostically useful PID biomarker antigens."
0,[Endometritis : Rare disease with clinical importance?],10.1007/s00292-016-0237-x,"Endometritis is nowadays rare in developed countries and typically shows a subclinical or mild course; therefore, there are probably more cases of endometritis than diagnosed but they lack clinical relevance. In the fertile period of life it can be the reason for vaginal bleeding and infertility. The most common causes for non-specific endometritis are residual placental tissue after abortion or childbirth, intrauterine interventions, lesions within the uterine cavity, such as endometrial polyps, endometrial hyperplasia and neoplasms, intrauterine devices (IUD) and cervical stenosis. The histological detection of plasma cells in the endometrial stroma is required for the diagnosis of chronic endometritis. These can be detected immunohistochemically using anti-CD138 antibodies, which should be carried out particularly in cases of infertility with only slight inflammatory symptoms and few plasma cells. The use of an IUD containing progestin is frequently associated with an asymptomatic lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. After curettage or endometrial biopsy, an eosinophilic xanthogranulomatous or granulomatous endometritis and also a foreign body granuloma reaction can occur. Specific forms of endometritis, such as caused by tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, mycoplasma and herpes are very rare. Cytomegalovirus endometritis is associated with immunosuppression. Endometritis caused by infections with Chlamydia trachomatis is characterized by an extensive lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. The differential diagnoses of chronic endometritis include the very rare malignant lymphoma, which is usually characterized by a relatively monotonous cell infiltration."

Complications of the enteritis component include mesenteric vasculitis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and protein-losing enteropathy. Lupus enteritis is very responsive to treatment with pulse steroids in almost 70% of the patients, but it is critical to diagnose it early to prevent devastating organ damage. The case describes a 21-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy (one month prior to the time of presentation), major depressive disorder, asthma, iron deficiency anemia, pelvic inflammatory disease secondary to sexually transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis infection, and SLE (diagnosed two weeks prior to presentation). She had been transferred from an outside facility with complaints of severe right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain for one day. The patient had run out of her prescription for steroids and hydroxychloroquine two days prior to the presentation. Her abdominal pain was accompanied by nausea, bilious vomiting, non-bloody diarrhea, a photosensitive facial rash, left-sided pressure-type periorbital headache, diplopia, oral ulcers, inappetence, joint stiffness, and muscle weakness. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis from an outside facility showed enteritis involving the proximal jejunum with associated mesenteric edema and ascites, suggesting infectious versus inflammatory or autoimmune etiology. A repeat CT scan a few days later confirmed these findings along with adjacent mesenteric fat stranding. Her autoimmune workup confirmed the serological diagnosis of SLE, and assessment of the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) confirmed the diagnosis of a severe SLE flare. Upper endoscopy detected edematous mucosa in the duodenum and jejunum without active bleeding, gastropathy, or ulceration. No surgical intervention was required. Her symptoms resolved with supportive care, pulse steroids, and hydroxychloroquine. She was discharged with instructions for outpatient follow-up with gastroenterology and rheumatology."
0,"Chlamydia trachomatis, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, and Epithelial Ovarian Cancer",10.1093/infdis/jiab017,"Epidemiologic, clinical, molecular and translational research findings support an interrelationship between Chlamydia trachomatis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Overall, the link between C. trachomatis, PID, and EOC seems to be relatively weak, although nondifferential misclassification bias may have attenuated the results. The predominant tubal origin of EOC and the role of chronic inflammation in tumorigenesis suggest that the association is biologically plausible. Thus, C. trachomatis and PID may represent potential risk factors or risk markers for EOC. However, many steps in this chain of events are still poorly understood and need to be addressed in future studies. Research gaps include time of exposure in relation to the long-term consequences and lag time to EOC. Data of differential risk for EOC between chlamydial and nonchlamydial PID is also needed. Another major research gap has been the absence of high-performance biomarkers for C. trachomatis, PID, and EOC, as well as EOC precursors. Biomarkers for C. trachomatis and PID leading to increased risk of EOC should be developed. If the association is confirmed, C. trachomatis and PID prevention efforts may play a role in reducing the burden of EOC."

(A. fragrans) is used to treat infection of the lower genital tract in gynecology, such as cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease. This study analyzed the therapeutic efficiency of A. fragrans on cervicitis and the inhibition mechanism of AF-p2 in MALP-2-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Materials and methods The anti- Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu) activity of A. fragrans and AF-p2 were determined by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The activity of A. fragrans extracts (AFext) was evaluated in female BALB/c mice with cervicitis induced by Uu. Furthermore, the therapeutic mechanism of AFext and AF-p2 on myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) pathway were studied in macrophage activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) irritated RAW264.7 cells. Results AFext could suppress the proliferation of Uu in vitro, including the azithromycin resistant strains. Meanwhile, AFext prevented cervicitis caused by Uu infection in BALB/c mice. Moreover, both AFext and AF-p2 could significantly suppress the nitric oxide (NO) production as well as other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β,IL-6,TNF-α) in MALP-2 stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, AF-p2 also down-regulated iNOS, p65, Iκ-Bα, MyD88 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels in RAW264.7 cells. Conclusion This study indicated that AFext had a therapeutic effect in cervicitis induced by Uu infection. Furthermore, the lead compound AF-p2 showed an anti-infectious effect in MALP-2 irritated RAW264.7 cells through downregulating MyD88-NF-κB signaling pathway."
0,Chlamydia trachomatis Genital Infections,10.15698/mic2016.09.525,"Etiology, transmission and protection: Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally. However, C. trachomatis also causes trachoma in endemic areas, mostly Africa and the Middle East, and is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Epidemiology, incidence and prevalence: The World Health Organization estimates 131 million new cases of C. trachomatis genital infection occur annually. Globally, infection is most prevalent in young women and men (14-25 years), likely driven by asymptomatic infection, inadequate partner treatment and delayed development of protective immunity. Pathology/Symptomatology: C. trachomatis infects susceptible squamocolumnar or transitional epithelial cells, leading to cervicitis in women and urethritis in men. Symptoms are often mild or absent but ascending infection in some women may lead to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), resulting in reproductive sequelae such as ectopic pregnancy, infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Complications of infection in men include epididymitis and reactive arthritis. Molecular mechanisms of infection: Chlamydiae manipulate an array of host processes to support their obligate intracellular developmental cycle. This leads to activation of signaling pathways resulting in disproportionate influx of innate cells and the release of tissue damaging proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment and curability: Uncomplicated urogenital infection is treated with azithromycin (1 g, single dose) or doxycycline (100 mg twice daily x 7 days). However, antimicrobial treatment does not ameliorate established disease. Drug resistance is rare but treatment failures have been described. Development of an effective vaccine that protects against upper tract disease or that limits transmission remains an important goal."
0,Sexually transmitted diseases and infertility,10.1016/j.ajog.2016.08.008,"Female infertility, including tubal factor infertility, is a major public health concern worldwide. Most cases of tubal factor infertility are attributable to untreated sexually transmitted diseases that ascend along the reproductive tract and are capable of causing tubal inflammation, damage, and scarring. Evidence has consistently demonstrated the effects of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae as pathogenic bacteria involved in reproductive tract morbidities including tubal factor infertility and pelvic inflammatory disease. There is limited evidence in the medical literature that other sexually transmitted organisms, including Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis, and other microorganisms within the vaginal microbiome, may be important factors involved in the pathology of infertility. Further investigation into the vaginal microbiome and other potential pathogens is necessary to identify preventable causes of tubal factor infertility. Improved clinical screening and prevention of ascending infection may provide a solution to the persistent burden of infertility."
0,"Female urogenital chlamydia: Epidemiology, chlamydia on pregnancy, current diagnosis, and treatment",10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103448,"Female urogenital chlamydia is a disease caused by Chlamydia trachomatis infection in the female urogenital tract. It is a common bacterial sexually transmitted disease. The bacteria is transmitted through sexual contact with an infected partner or from mother to newborn during vaginal delivery. The prevalence varies among studies and the number is possibly higher due to the lack of massive screening. Many patients were asymptomatic and still be able to transmit the disease. The undiagnosed and untreated disease could cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which leads to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. The prevalence among pregnant women is similar to non-pregnant women, therefore chlamydia screening in pregnant women is highly recommended. The nucleic acid amplification test is the most reliable method for the diagnosis due to high sensitivity. The current treatment is given by prescribing antibiotics."

Computerized tomography shows the thickening of the perihepatic fat, but definitive diagnosis is only possible by direct visualization by laparoscopy or laparotomy. We present a 33-year-old HIV-positive man with Chlamydia trachomatis proctitis who developed severe right upper abdominal quadrant pain. Abdominal ultrasound did not show any liver pathology, while computerized tomography revealed hepatic capsular thickening. After 21 days of doxycycline therapy, the patient's symptoms subsided. Based on the clinical presentation and liver computerized tomography examination, the diagnosis of proctitis and the resulting Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome was made.

0,Small Bowel Obstruction and Appendicitis in Patient With Fitz-Hughes-Curtis Syndrome,10.14740/jmc3947,"Fitz-Hughs-Curtis syndrome is a manifestation of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) which begins with sexually transmitted organisms such as Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) and, less commonly Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The infection is hypothesized to disseminate into the peritoneum via lymphatic, hematogenous, or ascending spread of the organisms. Progression of the disease can result in liver capsule inflammation (perihepatitis) and adhesion formation between organs. This case presentation illustrates a female who presented with symptomology consistent with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and acute appendicitis. The patient was incidentally found to have Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome during laparoscopic surgery, as noted by adhesions on peritoneal organs. These findings prompted a sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening which confirmed a C. trachomatis infection, completing the clinical picture for Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. This case report highlights the need for an increased index of suspicion for Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome in a young female who presents with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain in order to prevent future complications of PID, including infertility."

Representation within a 2,478-specimen retrospective study set was established by comparison to a 6-month audit of clinical C. trachomatis TMA (12,999 specimens) on the basis of the C. trachomatis detection rate, specimen source distribution, clinic location, and age. M. genitalium was detected in 282 (11.4%) patients. This rate was higher than those seen with T. vaginalis (9.0%; P = 0.005), C. trachomatis (6.2%), and N. gonorrhoeae (1.4%). Positive M. genitalium results were confirmed by repeat testing or alternative-target TMA at a rate of 98.7%. The mean age of the M. genitalium-infected females (24.7 years) was lower than that of the T. vaginalis-infected females (mean, 30.1 years; P < 0.0001) and higher than that of the C. trachomatis-infected females (mean, 23.8 years; P = 0.003). Of 566 patient encounters positive for at least one sexually transmitted infection (STI), 35.9% exhibited sole detection of M. genitalium (P ≤ 0.0004 versus sole detection of other STI agents) and 26.1% were solely positive for T. vaginalis (P < 0.0002 versus C. trachomatis). The M. genitalium and T. vaginalis detection rates among 755 patients at urban emergency departments were 14.6% and 13.0%, respectively (P = 0.37). A 10.0% M. genitalium detection rate from other facilities exceeded that of T. vaginalis (7.2%; P = 0.004). Incorporation of M. genitalium TMA into comprehensive testing programs would detect M. genitalium in a significant proportion of females, particularly those in outpatient obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) settings."
0,Effect of Time of Day of Infection on Chlamydia Infectivity and Pathogenesis,10.1038/s41598-019-47878-y,"Genital chlamydia infection in women causes complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal factor infertility, but it is unclear why some women are more susceptible than others. Possible factors, such as time of day of chlamydia infection on chlamydial pathogenesis has not been determined. We hypothesised that infections during the day, will cause increased complications compared to infections at night. Mice placed under normal 12:12 light: dark (LD) cycle were infected intravaginally with Chlamydia muridarum either at zeitgeber time 3, ZT3 and ZT15. Infectivity was monitored by periodic vaginal swabs and chlamydiae isolation. Blood and vaginal washes were collected for host immunologic response assessments. The reproductive tracts of the mice were examined histopathologically, and fertility was determined by embryo enumeration after mating. Mice infected at ZT3 shed significantly more C. muridarum than mice infected at ZT15. This correlated with the increased genital tract pathology observed in mice infected at ZT3. Mice infected at ZT3 were less fertile than mice infected at ZT15. The results suggest that the time of day of infection influences chlamydial pathogenesis, it indicates a possible association between complications from chlamydia infection and host circadian clock, which may lead to a better understanding of chlamydial pathogenesis."
0,VACCINES. A mucosal vaccine against Chlamydia trachomatis generates two waves of protective memory T cells,10.1126/science.aaa8205,"Genital Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infection induces protective immunity that depends on interferon-γ-producing CD4 T cells. By contrast, we report that mucosal exposure to ultraviolet light (UV)-inactivated Ct (UV-Ct) generated regulatory T cells that exacerbated subsequent Ct infection. We show that mucosal immunization with UV-Ct complexed with charge-switching synthetic adjuvant particles (cSAPs) elicited long-lived protection in conventional and humanized mice. UV-Ct-cSAP targeted immunogenic uterine CD11b(+)CD103(-) dendritic cells (DCs), whereas UV-Ct accumulated in tolerogenic CD11b(-)CD103(+) DCs. Regardless of vaccination route, UV-Ct-cSAP induced systemic memory T cells, but only mucosal vaccination induced effector T cells that rapidly seeded uterine mucosa with resident memory T cells (T(RM) cells). Optimal Ct clearance required both T(RM) seeding and subsequent infection-induced recruitment of circulating memory T cells. Thus, UV-Ct-cSAP vaccination generated two synergistic memory T cell subsets with distinct migratory properties."
0,MiR-378b Modulates Chlamydia-Induced Upper Genital Tract Pathology,10.3390/pathogens10050566,"Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection causes severe reproductive pathologies such as salpingitis and pelvic inflammatory disease that can lead to tubal factor infertility. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved regulators of mammalian gene expression in development, immunity and pathophysiologic processes during inflammation and infection, including Chlamydia infection. Among the miRNAs involved in regulating host responses and pathologic outcome of Chlamydia infection, we have shown that miR-378b was significantly differentially expressed during primary infection and reinfection. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that miR-378b is involved in the pathological outcome of Chlamydia infection. We developed miR-378b knockout mice (miR-378b-/-) using Crispr/Cas and infected them along with their wild-type (WT) control with Chlamydia to compare the infectivity and reproductive pathologies. The results showed that miR-378b-/- mice were unable to clear the infection compared to WT mice; also, miR-378b-/- mice exhibited a relatively higher Chlamydia burden throughout the duration of infection. However, gross pathology results showed that miR-378b-/- mice had significantly reduced uterine dilatations and pathologic lesions after two infections compared to WT mice. In addition, the pregnancy and fertility rates for infected miR-378b-/- mice showed protection from Chlamydia-induced infertility with fertility rate that was comparable to uninfected WT mice. These results are intriguing as they suggest that miR-378b is important in regulating host immune responses that control Chlamydial replication and drive the inflammation that causes complications such as infertility. The finding has important implications for biomarkers of Chlamydial complications and targets for prevention of disease."
0,Advancing the public health applications of Chlamydia trachomatis serology,10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30159-2,"Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection. Trachoma is caused by ocular infection with C trachomatis and is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. New serological assays for C trachomatis could facilitate improved understanding of C trachomatis epidemiology and prevention. C trachomatis serology offers a means of investigating the incidence of chlamydia infection and might be developed as a biomarker of scarring sequelae, such as pelvic inflammatory disease. Therefore, serological assays have potential as epidemiological tools to quantify unmet need, inform service planning, evaluate interventions including screening and treatment, and to assess new vaccine candidates. However, questions about the performance characteristics and interpretation of C trachomatis serological assays remain, which must be addressed to advance development within this field. In this Personal View, we explore the available information about C trachomatis serology and propose several priority actions. These actions involve development of target product profiles to guide assay selection and assessment across multiple applications and populations, establishment of a serum bank to facilitate assay development and evaluation, and development of technical and statistical methods for assay evaluation and analysis of serological findings. The field of C trachomatis serology will benefit from collaboration across the public health community to align technological developments with their potential applications."
0,IL-4-secreting eosinophils promote endometrial stromal cell proliferation and prevent Chlamydia-induced upper genital tract damage,10.1073/pnas.1621253114,"Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infections in women typically are asymptomatic and do not cause permanent upper genital tract (UGT) damage. Consistent with this presentation, type 2 innate and TH2 adaptive immune responses associated with dampened inflammation and tissue repair are elicited in the UGT of Chlamydia-infected women. Primary C. trachomatis infection of mice also causes no genital pathology, but unlike women, does not generate Chlamydia-specific TH2 immunity. Herein, we explored the significance of type 2 innate immunity for restricting UGT tissue damage in Chlamydia-infected mice, and in initial studies intravaginally infected wild-type, IL-10-/-, IL-4-/-, and IL-4Rα-/- mice with low-dose C. trachomatis inoculums. Whereas Chlamydia was comparably cleared in all groups, IL-4-/- and IL-4Rα-/- mice displayed endometrial damage not seen in wild-type or IL-10-/- mice. Congruent with the aberrant tissue repair in mice with deficient IL-4 signaling, we found that IL-4Rα and STAT6 signaling mediated IL-4-induced endometrial stromal cell (ESC) proliferation ex vivo, and that genital administration of an IL-4-expressing adenoviral vector greatly increased in vivo ESC proliferation. Studies with IL-4-IRES-eGFP (4get) reporter mice showed eosinophils were the main IL-4-producing endometrial leukocyte (constitutively and during Chlamydia infection), whereas studies with eosinophil-deficient mice identified this innate immune cell as essential for endometrial repair during Chlamydia infection. Together, our studies reveal IL-4-producing eosinophils stimulate ESC proliferation and prevent Chlamydia-induced endometrial damage. Based on these results, it seems possible that the robust type 2 immunity elicited by Chlamydia infection of human genital tissue may analogously promote repair processes that reduce phenotypic disease expression."
0,Genital Mycoplasmas and Biomarkers of Inflammation and Their Association With Spontaneous Preterm Birth and Preterm Prelabor Rupture of Membranes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,10.3389/fmicb.2022.859732,"Genital mycoplasmas (GM), such as Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma parvum, and Ureaplasma urealyticum are commonly associated with spontaneous preterm labor (SPTL), spontaneous preterm birth (PTB), and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM). This study determined the association between GM and such adverse pregnancy outcomes. We searched for studies published 1980-2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Studies were eligible when GM was detected during pregnancy. We included 93 and 51 studies in determining the prevalence and the inflammatory biomarkers associated with GM, respectively, using the ""metafor"" package within R. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (registration no. CRD42016047297). Women with the studied adverse pregnancy outcomes had significantly higher odds of presence with GM compared to women who delivered at term. For PTB, the odds ratios were: M. hominis (OR: 2.25; CI: 1.35-3.75; I 2: 44%), M. genitalium (OR: 2.04; CIL 1.18-3.53; I 2: 20%), U. parvum (OR: 1.75; CI: 1.47-2.07; I 2: 0%), U. urealyticum (OR: 1.50; CI: 1.08-2.07; I 2: 58%). SPTL had significantly higher odds with M. hominis (OR: 1.96; CI: 1.19-3.23; I 2: 1%) or U. urealyticum (OR: 2.37; CI: 1.20-4.70; I 2: 76%) compared to women without SPTL. Women with PPROM had significantly higher odds with M. hominis (OR: 2.09; CI: 1.42-3.08; I 2: 0%) than women without PPROM. However, our subgroup analysis based on the diagnostic test and the sample used for detecting GM showed a higher prevalence of GM in maternal samples than in fetal samples. GM presence of the cervix and vagina was associated with lower odds of PTB and preterm labor (PTL). In contrast, GM presence in the AF, fetal membrane, and placenta was associated with increased odds of PTB and PTL. However, genital mycoplasmas may not elicit the massive inflammation required to trigger PTB. In conclusion, GM presence in the fetal tissues was associated with significantly increased odds of PTB and PTL."

Current  guidelines recommend against routine screening for these organisms, since their  role in the pathogenesis of pelvic inflammatory disease and tubo-ovarian  abscesses (TOAs) remains unclear. However, genital mycoplasmas harbor pathogenic  potential in immunocompromised hosts, especially patients with  hypogammaglobulinemia. It is important to identify such infections early, given  their potential for invasive spread and the availability of easily accessible  treatments. We present a young adult female with multiple sclerosis and  iatrogenic hypogammaglobulinemia, with refractory, bilateral pelvic inflammatory  disease and TOAs due to Ureaplasma urealyticum, identified as a single pathogen  via three distinct molecular tests. To our knowledge, this is the second case of  TOAs caused by U. urealyticum in the literature, and the first diagnosed by  pathogen cell-free DNA metagenomic next-generation sequencing in plasma."
0,Update on new medicinal applications of gentamicin: evidence-based review,10.1016/j.jfma.2013.10.002,"Gentamicin (GM) was discovered in 1963 and was introduced into parenteral usage in 1971. Since then, GM has been widely used in medicinal applications. The Food and Drug Administration of the United States approved the routine prescription of GM to treat the following infectious disorders: infection due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacteriaceae spp., Pseudomonas spp.; Staphylococcus infectious disease; bacterial meningitis; bacterial sepsis of newborns; bacterial septicemia; infection of the eye, bone, skin and/or subcutaneous tissue; infective endocarditis; peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis due to Pseudomonas and other gram-negative organisms; peritonitis due to gastrointestinal tract infections; respiratory tract infections; and urinary tract infectious disease. GM is an old antibiotic and is used widely beyond its FDA-labeled indications as follows: actinomycotic infection; Staphylococcus saprophyticus bacteremia with pyelonephritis; appendicitis; cystic fibrosis; diverticulitis; adjunct regimen for febrile neutropenia; female genital infection; uterine infection; postnatal infection; necrotizing enterocolitis in fetus or newborn; osteomyelitis; pelvic inflammatory disease; plague; gonorrhea; tularemia; prophylaxis of post-cholecystectomy infection, transrectal prostate biopsy, and post-tympanostomy-related infection; malignant otitis externa; and intratympanically or transtympanically for Ménière's disease. GM is also used in combination regimens, such as with beta-lactam antibiotics to treat mixed infection and with bacteriophage to treat Staphylococcus aureus infections. It is also added to medical materials, such as GM-loaded cement spacers for osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint-associated infections. Overall, there are many medicinal applications for GM. To reduce the development of GM-resistant bacteria and to maintain its effectiveness, GM should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected as being caused by susceptible bacteria. In the future, we believe that GM will be used more widely in combination therapy and applied to medical materials for clinical applications. A definitive, appropriately powered study of this antibiotic and its clinical applications is now required, especially in terms of its effectiveness, safety, and cost."
1,"Increased Gonorrhea Cases - Utah, 2009-2014",10.15585/mmwr.mm6534a1,"Gonorrhea (caused by infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae) is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States (1). Left untreated, gonorrhea is associated with serious long-term adverse health effects, including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Infection also facilitates transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (2,3). Effective gonorrhea control relies upon early detection and effective antimicrobial treatment. To assess gonorrhea rate trends in Utah, the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) analyzed Utah National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (UT-NEDSS) data for the state during 2009-2014. After declining during 2009-2011, the statewide gonorrhea rate increased fivefold to 49 cases per 100,000 population in 2014. During 2009-2014, the proportion of cases among women increased from 21% to 39% (decreasing among males from 79% to 61%). Among male patients, the proportion who identified as men who have sex with men (MSM) decreased from 67% to 42%. These demographic changes suggest that increased heterosexual transmission of gonorrhea in Utah might be occurring. Health departments need to work with providers to ensure populations at high risk are being screened and properly treated for gonorrhea. Clinicians need to be aware of increases in the risk for infection among women and non-MSM males when making screening and testing decisions and educate their patients regarding gonorrhea transmission and prevention practices."

The population with highest prevalence is young sexually active adults aged 15-24 years. In a majority of cases, the presentation is asymptomatic however can range from vaginitis to pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Symptoms in men can include urethritis, epididymitis and proctitis. Disseminated disease is characterized by arthritis and tenosynovitis. Gonococcal endocarditis is a rare but life-threatening complication of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) occurring in 1-2% of patients with DGI (Shetty et al., 2004) [3]. Gonococcal endocarditis has a predisposition for aortic valve involvement with formation of large vegetation and valvular ring abscess. Only a handful of cases have been reported in the literature since the advent of penicillin. This case highlights the importance of timely diagnosis and appropriate surgical evaluation to prevent mortality in young patients that may present with this rare complication."
0,The Gonococcal Transcriptome during Infection of the Lower Genital Tract in Women,10.1371/journal.pone.0133982,"Gonorrhea is a highly prevalent disease resulting in significant morbidity worldwide, with an estimated 106 cases reported annually. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea, colonizes and infects the human genital tract and often evades host immune mechanisms until successful antibiotic treatment is used. The alarming increase in antibiotic-resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae, the often asymptomatic nature of this disease in women and the lack of a vaccine directed at crucial virulence determinants have prompted us to perform transcriptome analysis to understand gonococcal gene expression patterns during natural infection. We sequenced RNA extracted from cervico-vaginal lavage samples collected from women recently exposed to infected male partners and determined the complete N. gonorrhoeae transcriptome during infection of the lower genital tract in women. On average, 3.19% of total RNA isolated from female samples aligned to the N. gonorrhoeae NCCP11945 genome and 1750 gonococcal ORFs (65% of all protein-coding genes) were transcribed. High expression in vivo was observed in genes encoding antimicrobial efflux pumps, iron response, phage production, pilin structure, outer membrane structures and hypothetical proteins. A parallel analysis was performed using the same strains grown in vitro in a chemically defined media (CDM). A total of 140 genes were increased in expression during natural infection compared to growth in CDM, and 165 genes were decreased in expression. Large differences were found in gene expression profiles under each condition, particularly with genes involved in DNA and RNA processing, iron, transposase, pilin and lipoproteins. We specifically interrogated genes encoding DNA binding regulators and iron-scavenging proteins, and identified increased expression of several iron-regulated genes, including tbpAB and fbpAB, during infection in women as compared to growth in vitro, suggesting that during infection of the genital tract in women, the gonococcus is exposed to an iron deplete environment. Collectively, we demonstrate that a large portion of the gonococcal genome is expressed and regulated during mucosal infection including genes involved in regulatory functions and iron scavenging."
0,[Anual Report Epidemiology of gonorrohea (CIE 10: A54)],10.4067/s0716-10182018000400403,"Gonorrhea is produced by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is capable of infecting different types of mucous membranes depending on sexual practices. It is located preferably in the man's urethra and in the woman's cervix, also in the rectum and pharynx. Its main form of transmission is through unprotected sex and, occasionally, through the birth canal in newborns. This report presents the epidemiological situation of gonorrhea until 2016 in Chile. A descriptive analysis of the cases that entered the surveillance was carried out. Since 2000, there has been a progressive trend towards decreasing gonorrhea rates; However, in 2015 and 2016 there was an increase in the rate in relation to 2014. In 2016, 2,039 cases were presented, representing an increase of 38% with respect to the median of the previous five-year period (1,473 cases). Regarding the age of the cases, the greatest risk was found in the group of 15 to 24 years, highlighting that, as of 2013, the group rate of 15 to 19 years exceeded the group of 25 to 29 years. According to geographical distribution, the highest reporting rates were in the regions of the extreme north and south of the country, with the highest risk regions being Tarapacá, Antofagasta, Los Lagos and Aysén."
0,Updated treatment guidelines for gonorrhea infections,10.1111/1751-486X.12037,"Gonorrhea is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the United States. It continues to be a major cause of morbidity for women and has been linked to infertility and pelvic inflammatory disease. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised the current treatment guidelines for gonorrhea in response to the rising rates of antibiotic resistance. This column will discuss the new guidelines, including the rationale for the change as well as nursing implications to support timely and effective treatment of gonorrhea."
0,"Gonorrhea Control, United States, 1972-2015, A Narrative Review",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000515,"Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported infection. It can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Rates of gonorrhea decreased after the National Gonorrhea Control Program began in 1972, but stabilized in the mid 1990s. The emergence of antimicrobial resistant strains increases the urgency for enhanced gonorrhea control efforts. To identify possible approaches for improving gonorrhea control, we reviewed historic protocols, reports, and other documents related to the activities of the National Gonorrhea Control Program using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention records and the published literature. The Program was a massive effort that annually tested up to 9.3 million women, and treated up to 85,000 infected partners and 100,000 additional exposed partners. Reported gonorrhea rates fell by 74% between 1976 and 1996, then stabilized. Testing positivity was 1.6-4.2% in different settings in 1976. In 1999-2008, the test positivity of a random sample of 14- to 25-year-olds was 0.4%. Gonorrhea testing rates remain high, however, partner notification efforts decreased in the 1990s as attention shifted to human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. The decrease and subsequent stabilization of gonorrhea rates was likely also influenced by changes in behavior, such as increases in condom use in response to acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Renewed emphasis on partner treatment might lead to further decreases in rates of gonorrhea."
0,Management of Gonorrhea in Adolescents and Adults in the United States,10.1093/cid/civ731,"Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States and is associated with serious health sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Treatment for gonorrhea has been complicated by antimicrobial resistance. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to each of the antimicrobials that were previously recommended as first-line treatment regimens, and current treatment options are severely limited. This article summarizes the key questions and data that were discussed at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines Expert Consultation meeting in April 2013, and the rationale for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STD treatment guidelines for gonococcal infections in adolescents and adults. Key issues addressed include whether to change the dosage of ceftriaxone and azithromycin used in the recommended dual treatment regimen, whether to continue to list dual treatment with cefixime and azithromycin as an alternative treatment regimen, and management of gonococcal infections in persons with severe cephalosporin allergy or suspected treatment failure."
0,A Review of Recent Advances in Our Understanding of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.,10.7759/cureus.43464,"Gonorrhoea is an infection caused by bacteria that has recently been detected in humans and typically spreads through sexual contact. It leads to significant  health issues in both prosperous and impoverished countries, culminating in  significant yearly expenditures for diagnosis and treatment. Young adults who are  involved in unprotected sexual activity and are promiscuous are particularly  susceptible to gonorrhoea. It has been estimated that approximately 86.95 million  individuals globally acquire the virus each year. Gonorrhoea has been reported to  affect a variety of body parts, including the cervix in women and the urethra in  males, as well as other areas such as the eyes, anus, throat, and, on rare  occasions, the joints. It is momentarily the second most frequently reported  sexually transmitted disease (STD) by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC), trailing only chlamydia. Since the early 2000s, gonorrhoea  cases have been on the rise globally, especially across many European nations,  with an elevated prevalence among populations at higher risk of getting sexually  transmitted infections (STIs), such as men who have sex with men and young  heterosexual individuals. The fundamental objectives of gonorrhoea management  techniques are to prevent, identify, and cure infections in patients and their  partners in addition to minimizing the disease's stigma. It additionally involves  monitoring antibiotic resistance and treatment failures, and it also involves  advocating appropriate antimicrobial medication usage and stewardship."
0,Reproductive system infections in women: lower genital tract syndromes,10.1093/femspd/ftaa022,"Gynecological and obstetrical infectious diseases are an important component of women's health. A system approach to gynecological and obstetrical infection helps unify and classify microbial etiology and pathogenesis within a clinical anatomical framework of lower and upper genital tract syndromes. The reproductive system of women includes the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. During pregnancy, additional tissues include the chorioamnion and placenta together with the fetus and amniotic fluid. We review in two parts reproductive system infection syndromes in women using selected research results to illustrate the clinical utility of the system approach in terms of diagnosis, treatment and prevention. We conclude that a reproductive system perspective will lead to improvements in understanding, management and prevention of these diseases."

Although the pathogenic role of Mycoplasma genitalium in male urethritis is clear, fewer studies have been conducted among women to determine its pathogenic role in the female reproductive tract. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an important cause of infertility and ectopic pregnancy, and Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are recognized microbial causes. Emerging data demonstrate an association between M. genitalium and PID, and limited data suggest associations with infertility and preterm birth, yet the attributable risk for female genital tract infections remains to be defined. Further investigations are needed to better define the impact of M. genitalium on women's reproductive health. Importantly, prospective studies evaluating whether screening programs and targeted treatment of M. genitalium improve reproductive outcomes in women are necessary to guide public health policy for this emerging pathogen."
0,"Predominance of cervicitis agents with minimal testing rate within the student population in Benin city, Nigeria",10.1080/01443615.2019.1584888,"Here, we aimed to investigate the predominance of cervicitis agents with minimal testing rates among asymptomatic students in a Tertiary Institution and its associated risk factors. Endocervical swabs were collected from randomly selected 133 female students (15-34 years of age) in Benin City, Nigeria and screened for six genital pathogens (Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, M. genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, U. parvum and Trichomonas vaginalis) using multiplex PCR. Out of the 133 subjects, 80 were positive for cervicitis with 46.3% of its agents. Five different species of the pathogens were identified with highest and lowest prevalence as: T. vaginalis (71.0%) and U. urealyticum (6.45%). Co-infection had predominance of 19.35 and 9.67% for three-organism and two-organism colonisation respectively. Strong associations were observed between the presence of cervicitis and co-infection with other genital pathogens, abortion, inconsistent condom use (p < .05). The high occurrence of cervicitis agents in our study combined with asymptomatic outcome among the subjects justifies screening for these pathogens in this population. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Cervicitis is a genital condition among reproductive age women. It is characterised by inflammation of the uterine cervix which subsequently promotes the acquisition of certain genital conditions such as infertility and sexually transmitted infections. In various studies, there have been reports on 30-40% of cervicitis cases associated with known pathogens but left undetected within the general population. Studies have shown that majority of the cervicitis cases presents in an asymptomatic state. What the results of this study add? There may be some risk associated factors promoting the acquisition of cervicitis agents within the student population since the prevalence of these agents in this population which is underrated was relatively high. What the implication are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Further investigation is needed to define the prospective influence of microbial load in colonisation of the organism and the association of new and higher sexual partners as their prevalence are not fully understood. Furthermore, our finding recommend inclusion of screening exercise for cervicitis agents within the student population which will control the infection, thereby improving female reproductive health, consequently limiting spread and serious sequelae."
0,Comparison of nested and ELISA based polymerase chain reaction assays for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis in pregnant women with preterm complications,,"Identification of pregnant women infected with Chlamydia trachomatis is essential to allow early antibiotic treatment in order to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes. In this study, two nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) namely nested PCR (BioSewoom, Korea) and Amplicor CT/NG (Roche Diagnostic, USA) were evaluated in terms of sensitivity and specificity for the detection of C. trachomatis DNA in pregnant women with preterm complications. A cross-sectional study was carried out in two public hospitals in Southern Selangor, Malaysia. Endocervical swabs obtained were subjected to DNA amplification using nested PCR (BioSewoom, Korea) and Amplicor CT/NG (Roche Diagnostic, USA). A total of 83 endocervical swabs obtained from pregnant women of less than 37 weeks gestation and presented with preterm complications were subjected to chlamydial DNA detection using both assays. The study shows that Amplicor CT/NG assay is more effective in the detection of C. trachomatis DNA from endocervical swabs compared to Biosewoom nested PCR kit. Agreement between the two assays were poor (kappa=0.094) with nested PCR showing a low sensitivity of 10.81% and a 97.83% specificity when compared to Amplicor CT/NG. The results obtained indicated that BioSewoom nested PCR was less sensitive than Amplicor CT/ NG for detecting C. trachomatis in endocervical specimens and that another more reliable test is required for confirmatory result."
1,Screening for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement,10.1001/jama.2021.14081,"IMPORTANCE: Chlamydia and gonorrhea are among the most common sexually transmitted infections in the US. Infection rates are highest among adolescents and young adults of both sexes. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are usually asymptomatic and may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and its associated complications. Newborns of pregnant persons with untreated infection may develop neonatal chlamydial pneumonia or gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia. Infection in men may lead to urethritis and epididymitis. Both types of infection can increase risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV. OBJECTIVE: To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons. POPULATION: Asymptomatic, sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons. EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men. RECOMMENDATION: The USPSTF recommends screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men. (I statement)."
1,Efficacy of a Technology-Enhanced Community Health Nursing Intervention vs Standard of Care for Female Adolescents and Young Adults With Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.8652,"IMPORTANCE: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a common reproductive health disorder that disproportionately affects female adolescents and young adults. Despite data indicating poor adherence and adverse outcomes among those who experience subsequent Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infection, few trials have been designed to address this public health need. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of a technology-enhanced community health nursing (TECH-N) intervention vs standard of care for improving PID self-management behaviors and 90-day longitudinal prevalence of N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial of the TECH-N intervention was conducted among female patients 13 to 25 years of age diagnosed with mild to moderate PID who were being discharged to outpatient treatment from September 6, 2012, to December 8, 2016, at a large academic medical center. The final analysis of data was completed in November 2018. This study compared the efficacy of the intervention with that of the standard of care using an intention-to-treat analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Enrolled participants completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview, provided specimens for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis testing, and were randomized to standard treatment (n = 137) or the TECH-N intervention (n = 149). Intervention participants received text-messaging support and a community health nurse visit within 5 days of diagnosis. Change in the prevalence of N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis infection was estimated with logistic regression. The N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis positivity rate over time was evaluated using generalized estimating equations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the prevalence of N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis infection at 90-day follow-up. The secondary outcome was adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for self-care. RESULTS: A total of 286 patients (mean [SD] age, 18.8 [2.5] years; 268 [93.7%] African American) participated in the study. Although the study groups were demographically similar, the intervention group had a higher baseline rate of C trachomatis infection (45 of 139 [32.4%] vs 25 of 132 [18.9%], P = .01). Although N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis positivity was not statistically different between groups at 90-day follow-up (6 of 135 [4.4%] vs 13 of 125 [10.4%], P = .07), the differential rate of decrease was significantly higher in the intervention group (48 of 140 [34.4%] to 6 of 135 [4.4%] compared with 34 of 133 [25.6%] to 13 of 112 [10.4%], P = .02). Intervention participants were more likely to receive the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended short-term follow-up visit compared with the control group (131 of 139 [94.2%] vs 20 of 123 [16.3%], P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adolescent and young adults with PID in the TECH-N intervention were more likely to experience decreases in N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis positivity compared with the control group and to receive short-term clinical assessment. These findings suggest that the TECH-N intervention should be considered as a potential enhancement of standard of care approaches for management of female adolescents and young adults with mild to moderate PID in urban communities facing significant sexually transmitted infection disparities.

1,Screening for Chlamydial and Gonococcal Infections: Updated Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force,10.1001/jama.2021.10577,"IMPORTANCE: The 2014 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement supported the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in asymptomatic, sexually active women 24 years or younger and in older women at increased risk for infection, although evidence for screening in men was insufficient. OBJECTIVE: To update the 2014 USPSTF review on screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infection in adults and adolescents, including those who are pregnant. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ovid MEDLINE (January 1, 2014, through May 28, 2020) with surveillance through May 21, 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials and observational studies of screening effectiveness, accuracy of risk stratification and alternative screening methods, accuracy of tests, and screening harms. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Complications of infection; infection transmission or acquisition; diagnostic accuracy of anatomical site-specific testing and collection methods; screening harms. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included (N = 179 515). Chlamydia screening compared with no screening was significantly associated with reduced risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in 2 of 4 trials and with reduced hospital-diagnosed PID (0.24% vs 0.38%); relative risk, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.4-1.0]), but not clinic-diagnosed PID or epididymitis, in the largest trial. In studies of risk prediction instruments in asymptomatic women, age younger than 22 years demonstrated comparable accuracy to extensive criteria. Sensitivity of chlamydial testing was similar at endocervical (89%-100%) and self- and clinician-collected vaginal (90%-100%) sites for women and at meatal (100%), urethral (99%), and rectal (92%) sites for men but lower at pharyngeal sites (69.2%) for men who have sex with men. Sensitivity of gonococcal testing was 89% or greater for all anatomical samples. False-positive and false-negative testing rates were low across anatomical sites and collection methods. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Screening for chlamydial infection was significantly associated with a lower risk of PID in young women. Risk prediction criteria demonstrated limited accuracy beyond age. Testing for asymptomatic chlamydial and gonococcal infections was highly accurate at most anatomical sites, including urine and self-collected specimens. Effectiveness of screening in men and during pregnancy, optimal screening intervals, and adverse effects of screening require further evaluation."
1,Screening for Chlamydial and Gonococcal Infections: A Systematic Review Update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,,"In 2014, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in asymptomatic, sexually active women, aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. There was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening in men., To update the 2014 systematic review and synthesize evidence for the USPSTF on the effectiveness of screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infection in adults and adolescents, including those who are pregnant., Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2014 through May 2020) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (January 2014 through May 2020), and MEDLINE (January 2014 through May 2020), and manually reviewed reference lists); with surveillance through May 21, 2021., English-language trials and observational studies on screening effectiveness, accuracy of risk stratification and alternative screening methods, test accuracy, and screening harms., One investigator abstracted data and a second investigator checked data abstraction for accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality using methods developed by the USPSTF., 20 studies met inclusion criteria (N=179,515); seven studies were carried forward from the prior report. Three previously included trials of women found chlamydia screening associated with decreased risk of PID versus no screening, though effects were not statistically significant in two trials. One new, good-quality trial of young women and men in primary care clinics found screening for chlamydia associated with decreased risk of hospital diagnosed primary pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (Relative Risk [RR] 0.6; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.4 to 1.0), though absolute effects were small (absolute difference −0.137%). Screening was not associated with decreased risk of clinic diagnosed PID (RR 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.8) or epididymitis in men (RR 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.4). Three studies on the accuracy of risk prediction instruments in asymptomatic persons reported an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) that ranged from 0.64 to 0.73. Using age criteria alone (<22 years) to selectively screen women for chlamydial and gonococcal infection demonstrated similar accuracy (AUC 0.687, Standard Deviation [SD] 0.014) compared with more extensive risk criteria. Nine studies of diagnostic accuracy found high specificity across anatomic sites, including urine. Sensitivity was high for chlamydial testing in females for all anatomic sites including endocervical testing (range 89 to 100%) and vaginal testing (range 90 to 100%). Studies found high sensitivity of meatal (100%) urethral (99%) and rectal (92%) testing for chlamydia in males, but evidence was limited to one study each. Evidence on pharyngeal testing was limited to one study of MSM that demonstrated low sensitivity for chlamydial infection (69.2%) and higher sensitivity for gonococcal infection (89.1%). Gonococcal testing in females demonstrated highest sensitivity in vaginal samples (>98%) followed by endocervical (>96%) and urine samples (>89%). The sensitivity of urine testing for gonococcal infection in males was 93 to 100 percent, while sensitivity ranged from 89 to 100 percent for other sites. Three studies demonstrated that self- and clinician-collected vaginal samples for chlamydia and gonorrhea diagnosis were highly sensitive (90 to 100%); no studies meeting inclusion criteria compared collection methods in males. False-positive and false-negative rates were low for testing across anatomic sites and for self- versus clinician- collection of samples. No studies evaluated screening intervals or accuracy of concurrent testing for other infections. Data was lacking for effects of screening on psychosocial harms or effect on risk behaviors or risk perception., English language articles only; methodological limitations in the trials; most studies conducted in higher risk populations or settings; meta-analysis not performed; unable to assess for publication bias; studies lacking for pregnant individuals., Screening for chlamydial infection may reduce the incidence of PID in young women. Risk prediction criteria to identify persons with asymptomatic chlamydial or gonococcal infection are associated with limited accuracy and require further validation. Testing for asymptomatic chlamydial and gonococcal infections is accurate at most anatomic sites, using urine sampling, and using self-collected specimens. Research is needed to determine the effectiveness of screening in men, optimal screening intervals, and adverse effects of screening."
0,"'Catching chlamydia': combining cash incentives and community pharmacy access for increased chlamydia screening, the view of young people",10.1071/PY12135,"In Australia and elsewhere, chlamydia screening rates for those aged between 16 and 30 years continue to be low. Innovative, age-appropriate approaches are necessary to increase chlamydia screening among this target group to prevent short- and long-term consequences of the infection such as pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Studies have demonstrated that offering chlamydia screening in community pharmacies may be a useful adjunct to current screening services. Approximately 90% of Australians visit a pharmacy at least once a year. Chlamydia screening and education in community pharmacies with remuneration may provide another option for opportunistic testing as part of a national chlamydia screening scheme. Compensation is an accepted practice in the field of research and has been demonstrated to improve adherence to health promotion activities. In 2011, a cross-sectional study of community pharmacy-based chlamydia screening offered in conjunction with an A$10 cash incentive to participate was conducted in the Australian Capital Territory. As part of this study young people were asked about their experience of, and views about, pharmacy-based chlamydia screening. The views of consented participants were collected using the one-page questionnaire consisting of 10 closed questions and one open-ended question. Participants completed the questionnaire when they returned their urine sample and before being given the cash incentive. Overall participants were highly satisfied with the pharmacy-based chlamydia screening service. Over 60% of questionnaire respondents felt that the payment did affect their decision to have the chlamydia test, and 23% stated that it made no difference. Young people reported that pharmacy-based screening is acceptable and convenient. Accessibility and the small cash incentive played significant roles in increasing participation."

Multiple limitations to performing new clinical trials exist; however, emerging data from ongoing clinical trials will add to the current body of knowledge regarding prevention and treatment strategies. In addition, use of established health care databases could serve as a valuable tool for performance of unbiased epidemiologic outcome studies."
0,Repurposed Drugs That Block the Gonococcus-Complement Receptor 3 Interaction Can Prevent and Cure Gonococcal Infection of Primary Human Cervical Epithelial Cells,10.1128/mBio.03046-19,"In the absence of a vaccine, multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae has emerged as a major human health threat, and new approaches to treat gonorrhea are urgently needed. N. gonorrhoeae pili are posttranslationally modified by a glycan that terminates in a galactose. The terminal galactose is critical for initial contact with the human cervical mucosa via an interaction with the I-domain of complement receptor 3 (CR3). We have now identified the I-domain galactose-binding epitope and characterized its galactose-specific lectin activity. Using surface plasmon resonance and cellular infection assays, we found that a peptide mimic of this galactose-binding region competitively inhibited the N. gonorrhoeae-CR3 interaction. A compound library was screened for potential drugs that could similarly prohibit the N. gonorrhoeae-CR3 interaction and be repurposed as novel host-targeted therapeutics for multidrug-resistant gonococcal infections in women. Two drugs, methyldopa and carbamazepine, prevented and cured cervical cell infection by multidrug-resistant gonococci by blocking the gonococcal-CR3 I-domain interaction.IMPORTANCE Novel therapies that avert the problem of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with acquired antibiotic resistance are urgently needed. Gonococcal infection of the human cervix is initiated by an interaction between a galactose modification made to its surface appendages, pili, and the I-domain region of (host) complement receptor 3 (CR3). By targeting this crucial gonococcal-I-domain interaction, it may be possible to prevent cervical infection in females. To this end, we identified the I-domain galactose-binding epitope of CR3 and characterized its galactose lectin activity. Moreover, we identified two drugs, carbamazepine and methyldopa, as effective host-targeted therapies for gonorrhea treatment. At doses below those currently used for their respective existing indications, both carbamazepine and methyldopa were more effective than ceftriaxone in curing cervical infection ex vivo This host-targeted approach would not be subject to N. gonorrhoeae drug resistance mechanisms. Thus, our data suggest a long-term solution to the growing problem of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infections."

Positive and negative agreements between the cobas 4800 CT/NG and cobas TaqMan CT tests were 92.7 % [95 % confidence interval (CI), 82.7-97.1 %] and 99.2 % (95 % CI, 98.2-99.7 %), respectively, with an overall agreement of 98.7 % (699/708). The clinical sensitivity of the cobas 4800 CT/NG assay for C. trachomatis ranged from 90.9 to 100 % depending on specimen type, with an overall prevalence of 7.2 % (51/708). The clinical specificity ranged from 99.1 to 100 % depending on specimen type. Dilution of 25 µl semen samples in cobas PCR medium proved to be the most sensitive protocol with the lowest inhibition rate. In conclusion, the cobas 4800 CT/NG test was found to be an effective method for detection of C. trachomatis in semen, male urine and genital swab samples collected dry or in universal transport medium."
1,Current perspectives in the USA on the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease in adolescents,10.2147/AHMT.S115535,"In this review, the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are discussed from a USA perspective and the difficulties that USA adolescents face in recognizing and seeking care for PID and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are emphasized. Females aged 15-24 years have the highest incidence of cervical infection with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrheae, the principal causes of PID. PID is common in this age group. However, the incidence of PID in the USA is not known, because it is not a reportable disease, and because clinicians vary in the criteria used for the diagnosis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended the following diagnostic criteria that include lower abdominal or pelvic pain and at least one of the following: adnexal tenderness or cervical motion tenderness or uterine tenderness. Because PID can have serious sequelae, the criteria emphasize sensitivity (few false-negatives) at the expense of specificity (some false-positives). Patients who have PID are usually treated in the outpatient setting, following the CDC's Guidelines for the Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases 2015. They receive one dose of an intramuscular cephalosporin, together with 2 weeks of oral doxy cycline, and sometimes oral metronidazole. Improvement should usually be evident in 3 days. The USA does not offer comprehensive sex education for adolescents in public or private schools. Adolescents are unlikely to recognize the symptoms of PID and seek medical treatment. Confidentiality is important to adolescents, and low cost or free sources of confidential care are uncommon, making it unlikely that an adolescent would seek care even if she suspected an STI. The CDC has concluded that screening programs for chlamydia and gonorrhea infection help prevent PID; however, the lack of appropriate sources of care makes adolescents' participation in screening programs unlikely."
0,Steroids alone or as adjunctive therapy with doxycycline fail to improve oviduct damage in mice infected with Chlamydia muridarum,10.1128/CVI.00006-14,"In women, Chlamydia trachomatis can ascend from the cervix to the fallopian tubes, where an overly aggressive host inflammatory response can cause scarring that leads to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy. Although screening and treatment programs for women have resulted in decreased rates of sequelae, morbidities associated with oviduct scarring continue to occur. Since corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, we tested the ability of dexamethasone to inhibit inflammation and prevent oviduct scarring in mice genitally infected with Chlamydia muridarum. The administration of 1 or 2.5 mg/kg of body weight of dexamethasone on days 7 to 21 of infection resulted in reduced accumulation of inflammatory cells in the oviducts compared to that in controls. However, a concomitant increase in bacterial burden was observed, and chronic oviduct disease was not reduced. Adjunctive administration of a prolonged (21-day) or short (3-day) course of dexamethasone in combination with the antibiotic doxycycline also failed to reduce chronic oviduct pathology compared to antibiotic treatment alone. Steroids administered alone or adjunctively with antibiotics failed to prevent oviduct damage in this murine model of C. trachomatis infection."
0,Addressing the rising rates of gonorrhea and drug-resistant gonorrhea: There is no time like the present,10.14745/ccdr.v45i23a02,"Increasing rates of gonococcal (GC) infection and antimicrobial resistant (AMR) GC, are a serious public health concern for Canada and around the world. Previously recommended treatments are ineffective against many of the gonorrhea strains circulating today. The current recommendation for combination therapy is now being threatened by globally emerging and increasingly resistant strains. It is important that coordinated efforts be made now to ensure these new global strains do not become established in Canada. Otherwise, we will be faced with the possibility of persistent GC infection which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and chronic pelvic pain in women; and epididymitis in men. The presence of GC can also increase the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. There are a number of reasons why we are facing this public health threat. GC infection is often asymptomatic and it is highly transmissible. People may hesitate to seek testing (or to offer testing). Treatment is complex: recommendations vary by site of infection and risk of resistance. Sexual contact during travel is an important source of imported emerging resistant global strains. The new screening and diagnostic Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) is excellent but has decreased the number of cultures being done and therefore our capacity to track AMR-GC. There are four key actions that clinicians and front-line public health professionals can take to stem the increase in rates of GC and drug resistant GC. First, normalize and increase GC screening based on risk factors and emphasize the need for safer sex practices. NAAT is useful for screening, but culture is still needed for extra-genital sites. Second, conduct pretravel counselling and include a travel history as part of the risk assessment. Third, use culture along with NAAT to establish the diagnosis and follow up for test-of-cure. Finally, refer to the most current Canadian Guidelines on Sexually Transmitted Infections or provincial/territorial recommendations on combination therapies for patients and their contacts as recommendations may have changed in response to evolving AMR-GC trends."
0,[No firm evidence for screening for Chlamydia in connection with spontaneous abortion],,Infection with genital Chlamydia while undergoing a vaginal instrumentation increases the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease with pain and sterility as sequelae. A literature study was performed in order to find out if screening and treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis should be offered to all women with miscarriages. This article reviews the available literature on the topic. The results show that there is a need for larger clinical trials before an evidence-based answer can be given.
1,"Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection among persons aged 14-39 years--United States, 2007-2012",,"Infection with the bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis (often termed ""chlamydia"") is the most frequently reported sexually transmitted infection in the United States. The urethra is the most common site of infection in males, and the urethra and cervix are most commonly infected in females. Ascending infection in females can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can lead to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Genital chlamydial infections are usually asymptomatic, and screening is necessary to identify most infections. Currently, chlamydia screening for sexually active women aged <25 years is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (grade B recommendation). Chlamydia is nationally notifiable; however, if females do not access care or clinicians do not screen, many infections go undiagnosed, unreported, and untreated. CDC monitors population prevalence of genital chlamydial infection through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which tests a sample of the U.S. population aged 14-39 years for genital C. trachomatis and found that the overall chlamydia burden in the United States decreased during 1999-2008. Using data from the most recent cycles of NHANES (2007-2012), CDC estimated chlamydia prevalence among persons aged 14-39 years overall and by demographic characteristics and sexual behaviors. The prevalence of chlamydia among persons aged 14-39 years was 1.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4%-2.0%). Chlamydia prevalence varied by age and race/ethnicity, with prevalence highest among non-Hispanic blacks (5.2%). Among sexually active females aged 14-24 years, the population targeted for routine screening, chlamydia prevalence was 4.7% overall and 13.5% among non-Hispanic black females. As chlamydia is common and infections are usually asymptomatic, health care providers should routinely screen sexually active young women aged <25 years for chlamydial infection, provide prompt treatment for infected persons, and ensure that infected patients' sex partners receive timely treatment to prevent reinfection."
1,"Chlamydial and Gonococcal Infections: Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment",,"Infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are increasing in the United States. Because most infections are asymptomatic, screening is key to preventing complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility and decreasing community and vertical neonatal transmission. All sexually active people with a cervix who are younger than 25 years and older people with a cervix who have risk factors should be screened annually for chlamydial and gonococcal infections. Sexually active men who have sex with men should be screened at least annually. Physicians should obtain a sexual history free from assumptions about sex partners or practices. Acceptable specimen types for testing include vaginal, endocervical, rectal, pharyngeal, and urethral swabs, and first-stream urine samples. Uncomplicated gonococcal infection should be treated with a single 500-mg dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone in people weighing less than 331 lb (150 kg). Preferred chlamydia treatment is a seven-day course of doxycycline, 100 mg taken by mouth twice per day. All nonpregnant people should be tested for reinfection approximately three months after treatment or at the first visit in the 12 months after treatment. Pregnant patients diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea should have a test of cure four weeks after treatment."
0,The negative impact of most relevant infections on fertility and assisted reproduction technology,10.23736/S2724-606X.21.04870-3,"Infections may act with variable impact on the physiopathology of the reproductive organs, determining infertility or reducing the outcomes of assisted reproduction technology. The aim of this narrative review is to describe the existing evidence regarding the pathogens with a supposed or recognized role in reproductive medicine. Viral hepatitis, as well as HIV, can reduce sperm quality. Syphilis carries a risk of erectile dysfunction and increased endometrial thickness. Chlamydia is the main cause of pelvic inflammatory disease. In relation to Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp., only few species seem to show a correlation with infertility and poor in-vitro fertilization outcomes. There is evidence of a role for bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy loss. HPV infection in males seems to determine infertility. Herpesviruses are more a risk for fetuses than for fertility itself. Zika virus is responsible for altered early embryo development and waiting to conceive is recommended in suspected or confirmed cases. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be elucidated. Rubella and toxoplasmosis can provoke important congenital defects and therefore screening is mandatory before conception; a vaccine for Rubella is recommended. Further and well-designed studies are still needed to better elucidate the role of some infectious agents, to improve fertility and its treatments."
1,"Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of Tubo-Ovarian Abscess, Hydrosalpinx, Pyosalpinx, and Oophoritis in Emergency Department Patients",10.7759/cureus.11647,"Introduction Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a spectrum of illness ranging from mild illness to more severe forms including tubo-ovarian abscess, hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, oophoritis (THPO). The objective of the study was to report rates and clinical characteristics of females presenting to the ED with a diagnosis of THPO in relationship to the presence or absence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Methods A database of ED patient encounters occurring from April 18, 2014, to March 7, 2017 was created. Analysis of women diagnosed with THPO and who had testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas by nucleic acid amplification testing or who had a vaginal wet preparation was performed. Patient demographics, ED diagnoses, laboratory tests, medications administered in the ED, and medications prescribed were examined. Categorical variables were summarized as count and percentages and analyzed using the Chi-square test. Continuous variables were summarized as the mean and standard deviation and analyzed using the t-test. All statistical tests were two-sided with a significance level of 0.05. Results THPO was diagnosed in 0.3% (56/17,905) of patient encounters. There were 50% (28/56) of women with THPO admitted to the hospital. There were 25.0% (12/48) women who received a positive test result for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and/or Trichomonas vaginalis. Women with THPO were significantly older, more likely to be infected with gonorrhea, and more likely to be diagnosed with sepsis and PID (P<.05 for all). Conclusions THPO is an infrequently encountered entity in the ED. A diagnosis of STI, PID, and sepsis can accompany these presentations. Although an uncommon diagnosis, ED providers must be attentive to patients presenting with pelvic symptoms that could be consistent with THPO to mitigate any complications that may arise and to direct the appropriate treatment."
0,Comparison of the CT OligoGen kit with cobas 4800 assay for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis,10.1016/j.eimc.2015.02.017,"INTRODUCTION: A prospective study was designed to assess the performance of the new CT OligoGen kit and the cobas 4800 assay for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis. METHODS: A set of samples that included urine samples (n=212), endocervical (n=167), rectal (n=53), pharyngeal (n=7) and urethral swabs (n=3). The samples were sent from a regional sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic in Seville, Spain, and were collected from 261 men and 181 women. Discordant results were re-analyzed and clinical data and other tests were reviewed in order to resolve them. RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predicative value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and kappa value for C. trachomatis detection using the CT OligoGen kit were 98.5%, 100%, 100%, 95.4% and 0.97, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This new kit had a high sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for C. trachomatis, therefore the performance profile confirms the usefulness and reliable results of this new assay."
1,HIV Screening Rates among Medicaid Enrollees Diagnosed with Other Sexually Transmitted Infections,10.1371/journal.pone.0161560,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 20 million new sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are diagnosed yearly in the United States costing the healthcare system an estimated $16 billion in direct medical expenses. The presence of other STIs increases the risk of HIV transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has long recommended routine HIV screening for individuals with a diagnosed STI. Unfortunately, HIV screening prevalence among STI diagnosed patients are still sub-optimal in many healthcare settings. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of STI-diagnosed persons in the Medicaid population who are screened for HIV, examine correlates of HIV screening, and to suggest critical intervention points to increase HIV screening in this population. METHODS: A retrospective database analysis was conducted to examine the prevalence and correlates of HIV screening among participants. Participant eligibility was restricted to Medicaid enrollees in 29 states with a primary STI diagnosis (chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) or pelvic inflammatory disease claim in 2009. HIV-positive persons were excluded from the study. Frequencies and descriptive statistics were conducted to characterize the sample in general and by STI diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to estimate unadjusted odds ratios and adjusted odds ratio respectively and the 95% confidence intervals. Multivariate logistic regression models that included the independent variables (race, STI diagnosis, and healthcare setting) and covariates (gender, residential status, age, and state) were analyzed to examine independent associations with HIV screening. RESULTS: About 43% of all STI-diagnosed study participants were screened for HIV. STI-diagnosed persons that were between 20-24 years, female, residing in a large metropolitan area and with a syphilis diagnosis were more likely to be screened for HIV. Participants who received their STI diagnosis in the emergency department were less likely to be screened for HIV than those diagnosed in a physician's office. CONCLUSION: This study showed that HIV screening prevalence among persons diagnosed with an STI are lower than expected based on the CDC's recommendations. These suboptimal HIV screening prevalence present ""missed opportunities"" for HIV screening in at-risk populations. Measures and incentives to increase HIV screening among all STI-diagnosed persons are vital to the timely identification of HIV infection, linkage to HIV care, and mitigating further HIV transmission."
0,Chlamydia antibody testing helps in identifying females with possible tubal factor infertility,,"INTRODUCTION: Chlamydia is an important cause of sexually transmitted diseases leading to tubal factor infertility. BACKGROUND: This study aims to define the role of chlamydial antibody detection in predicting presence, nature and type of tubal pathology in laparoscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 200 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopy as a part of infertility work-up. Preoperatively, serological determination of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific antibodies against Chlamydia Trachomatis was done by Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Findings of laparoscopy were evaluated against presence or absence of chlamydial antibodies in serum. RESULTS: Out of 200 patients,10 patients tested positive for chlamydial antibody. Chlamydial antibody was found positive in 20% and 22.7% of patients with tubal pathology and peri-hepatic adhesions of patients, respectively. The sensitivity of chlamydial antibody for diagnosing tubal pathology was found to be 20%, while specificity was 100%. The positive chlamydial antibody test was not statistically associated with involvement of one or both tubes and site of tubal block. CONCLUSION: Chlamydia antibody test does not appear to be good screening test for tubal pathology especially in Indian subcontinent. In view of its high specificity, this test can be used to identify patients with higher chances of tubal pathology requiring operative intervention."
0,Performance of the Abbott Real Time CT/NG assay in urines and cervico-vaginal samples from Senegal,10.3855/jidc.4026,"INTRODUCTION: Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the most common causes of sexually transmitted disease in Senegal and worldwide. Molecular techniques have become the standard for their detection, and due to the frequency of co-infections, these tests can detect both agents and can be used on urine samples, vaginal swabs, or endocervical samples. In developing countries, the use of these molecular techniques is very limited and there is a need for evaluations of these techniques to be done. METHODOLOGY: A total of 181 samples were tested with the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay and compared with the Roche Cobas Amplicor CT/NG assay. Specimens were collected from the key population of men having sex with men (urine, n = 60), female sex workers (genital swabs, n = 60) and from women visiting the laboratory for a gynecological checkup (urine, n = 60 and endocervical samples, n = 61). RESULTS: The agreement between the two techniques was 98.90% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.98. A sensitivity of 93.3%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 93.3% were found for both Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. CONCLUSION: These results showed that both methods are similar and suitable for the detection of CT/NG in all types of samples examined in this study."
0,[The diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis cervical infection among students by using classical and molecular methods],10.2298/sarh1304187t,"INTRODUCTION: Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of sexually transmitted disease. The possibility of serious complications may be prevented by early detection of the bacteria on the uterine cervix by the application of sensitive and reliable tests such as up-to-date molecular tests. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was the comparison of sensitivity and specificity of three different methods in the diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection. METHODS: The study included 69 female students referred to the gynecological outpatient unit at the Students' Polyclinic for colposcopic examination of the uterine cervix. Cervical Chlamydia trachomatis was diagnosed by using three different methods: direct immunofluorescence (DIF), nucleic acid hybridization assay (hc2), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: By using DIF Chlamydia trachomatis was identified in four students (5.80%), by using hc2 also in four (5.80%), while by using PCR test in six students (8.70%). Comparative analysis of the obtained results evidenced sensitivity and specificity rates of DIF in comparison to PCR method of 46% and 95%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of DIF method in comparison to hc2 was 62% and 97%. Sensitivity and specificity of hc2 method in comparison to PCR was 76% and 100%. CONCLUSION: Contemporary molecular methods, such as PCR, are methods of choice for the identification of endocervical Chlamydia trachomatis in the population of university students without symptoms of the disease."
0,[The Comparison of Real-Time PCR and direct immunofluorescence in laboratory diagnostics of chlamydiosis in patients of Department of Dermatology and Venereology Medical University of Warsaw],,"INTRODUCTION: Chlamydial infection is one of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted diseases. The aim of the study was to compare Real Time PCR and Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF) in laboratory diagnostics of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in patients of Department of Dermatology and Venereology in Warsaw. METHODS: We investigated the urethral, cervical, anal and pharyngeal specimens from 152 patients of Department of Dermatology and Venereology in Warsaw. We used DNA Bact Extra Pure Kit (Euroclone®) to isolate DNA. Real Time PCR DUPLICα® 2nd Generation Detection Real Time Advanced Dual Easy Chlamydia trachomatis Kit (Euroclone®) was performed on termocycler Smart Cycler® Dx. For direct immunofluorescence we used MicroTrack Chlamydia trachomatis Direct Specimen Test (Trinity Biotech). RESULTS: In 90% of cases of Real Time PCR and DIF were consistent. 9% of samples were DIF negative and PCR positive and 1% were PCR negative and DIF positive. The results of PCR and DIF were identical more often in woman (98%)than in men (84%). In patients after antibiotics treatment the results of the two tests were consistent in 88%. CONCLUSIONS: In laboratory diagnostics of C. trachomatis infections the results of the Real Time PCR and DIF were highly consistent although Real Time PCR. was more sensitive than DIF."
0,"Comparison of Mycoplasma IES, Mycofast Revolution and Mycoplasma IST2 to detect genital mycoplasmas in clinical samples",10.3855/jidc.8039,"INTRODUCTION: Culture is regarded as the gold standard for the detection of genital mycoplasma in clinical samples. Commercially available diagnostic kits, based on liquid broth cultures, provide interesting alternatives to conventional culture. We assessed the laboratory performances of Mycoplasma IES (IES), the Mycofast Revolution (REV) and Mycoplasma IST 2 (IST2) compared to A7 agar plates for the detection of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in clinical samples. METHODOLOGY: From April to July 2013, endocervical or vaginal samples were collected from sexually active women with abnormal vaginal discharge. Each specimen was tested in parallel using the three commercial kits and the A7 agar plates. RESULTS: A total of 303 samples were included in this study, 35.6% (108/303) of which were positive on A7 plates. Sensitivities for the detection of U. urealyticum of IES, REV and IST2 were 100%, 96.2% and 95.3%, respectively while those for M. hominis were of 92.8%, 92.8% and 85.7%, respectively. Specificity was 100% for the 3 methods. Concerning antimicrobial susceptibility testing, full agreement between IES and REV was documented. CONCLUSIONS: The Mycoplasma IES kit was found to be equivalent or superior compared to other commercial culture-based assays for a rapid and accurate identification of U. urealyticum and M. hominis and detection of resistance. It might be considered a cost-effective tool for detection of these organisms, particularly attractive in developing countries."
0,"Cervical Cytology of Samples with Ureaplasma urealyticum, Ureaplasma parvum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae Detected by Multiplex PCR",10.1155/2020/7045217,"INTRODUCTION: Despite increasing application of molecular diagnostic methods for the detection of sexually transmitted infections, the cytological findings in pap smears of patients with pathogens that can be identified only by PCR are not yet well described. The aim of this study was to describe the most common cytological features in cervical pap smears of patients with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Ureaplasma parvum detected by multiplex PCR. METHODS: Cervical samples for conventional and liquid-based cytology and for multiplex PCR were collected from women ranging from 23 to 54 years old, who underwent routine screening at a gynecological Unit. RESULTS: Multiplex PCR was positive in 36.2% of the samples: Ureaplasma parvum 14.9%, Chlamydia trachomatis 10.6%, Trichomonas vaginalis 10.6%, Mycoplasma hominis 8.5%, Ureaplasma urealyticum 4.2%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 2.1%, and Mycoplasma genitalium (0). Multiple pathogens were observed in 12.8% of samples. Microscopic cervicitis (≥10 polymorphonuclear leukocytes/epithelial cell) and normal (predominantly lactobacillary) microbiota were the most frequent findings in the samples in which the pathogens were detected alone or in multiple infections, except for samples with Trichomonas vaginalis in which the coccobacillary microbiota was the most common. In samples with microscopic cervicitis and normal microbiota, those with at least one pathogen identified by multiplex PCR were significantly more frequent than those with no pathogen, 66.6% versus 33.3%. CONCLUSION: Failure to identify an inflammatory agent in pap smear with intense neutrophil exudate may suggest the presence of Ureaplasma parvum, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, or Trichomonas vaginalis. A remark on the intensity of inflammation should be made in the reports of cervical pap smears so that this cytological finding can be correlated with clinical and PCR results."
0,Value of light microscopy to diagnose urogenital gonorrhoea: a diagnostic test study in Indonesian clinic-based and outreach sexually transmitted infections services,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016202,"INTRODUCTION: Gonorrhoea is a common sexually transmitted disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) infection. Light microscopy of urogenital smears is used as a simple tool to diagnose urogenital gonorrhoea in many resource-limited settings. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of light microscopy to diagnose urogenital gonorrhoea as compared with a PCR-based test. METHODS: In 2014, we examined 632 male urethral and 360 endocervical smears in clinic-based and outreach settings in Jakarta, Yogyakarta and Denpasar, Indonesia. Using the detection of Ng DNA by a validated PCR as reference test, we evaluated the accuracy of two light microscopic criteria to diagnose urogenital gonorrhoea in genital smears: (1) the presence of intracellular Gram-negative diplococci (IGND) and (2) ≥5 polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL)/oil-immersion field (oif) in urethral or ≥20 PMNL/oif in endocervical smears. RESULTS: In male urethral smears, IGND testing had a sensitivity (95% CI), specificity (95% CI) and kappa±SE of 59.0% (50.1 to 67.4), 89.4% (86.3 to 91.9) and 0.49±0.04, respectively. For PMNL count, these were 59.0% (50.1 to 67.4), 83.7% (80.2 to 86.9) and 0.40±0.04, respectively. The accuracy of IGND in the clinic-based settings (72.0% (57.5 to 83.3), 95.2% (91.8 to 97.5) and 0.68±0.06, respectively) was better than in the outreach settings (51.2% (40.0 to 62.3), 83.4% (78.2 to 87.8) and 0.35±0.06, respectively). In endocervical smears, light microscopy performed poorly regardless of the setting or symptomatology, with kappas ranging from -0.09 to 0.24. CONCLUSION: Light microscopy using IGND and PMNL criteria can be an option with moderate accuracy to diagnose urethral gonorrhoea among males in a clinic-based setting. The poor accuracy in detecting endocervical infections indicates an urgent need to implement advanced methods, such as PCR. Further investigations are needed to identify the poor diagnostic outcome in outreach services."
0,[The Comparison of Real-Time PCR and bacterial culture in laboratory diagnostics of gonorrhoea in patients of Department of Dermatology and Venereology Medical University of Warsaw],,"INTRODUCTION: Gonorrhoea is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the world. Fast and effective laboratory diagnostics of the infection is very important. The aim of the study was to compare Real-Time PCR and bacterial culture in diagnostics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in patients of Department of Dermatology and Venereology Medical University of Warsaw. METHODS: The urethral, cervical, anal and pharyngeal specimens from 93 patients of Department of Dermatology and Venereology Medical University of Warsaw were examined by two methods. The bacterial culture was performed on chocolate agar plates with antibiotics in the 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. N. gonorrhoeae was identified by colony-morphology, Gram stain and oxidase reaction, followed by carbohydrate utilization test. The DNA Bact Extra Pure Kit (Euroclone®) to isolate DNA was used. Real-Time PCR DUPLICα® Real-Time Neisseria gonorrhoeae 2nd Generation Detection Kit (Euroclone®) was performed using Smart Cycler® Dx. RESULTS: In 85.9% of results of Real-Time PCR and culture were identical. The remaining 14.1% of samples were culture negative and PCR positive. The results ofthe Real-Time PCR and culture were more often concordant in the case of samples obtained from men (96.8%) than from woman (85%). In patients after treatment with antibiotics the concordance of the results obtained with these two methods was 81%. CONCLUSIONS: In laboratory diagnostics of N. gonorrhoeae infections, Real-Time PCR was more sensitive than the culture, but in some cases it was less specific."
0,Human ABO Blood Groups and Their Associations with Different Diseases,10.1155/2021/6629060,"INTRODUCTION: Human ABO blood type antigens exhibit alternative phenotypes and genetically derived glycoconjugate structures that are located on the red cell surface which play an active role in the cells' physiology and pathology. Associations between the blood type and disease have been studied since the early 1900s when researchers determined that antibodies and antigens are inherited. However, due to lack of antigens of some blood groups, there have been some contentious issues with the association between the ABO blood group and vulnerability to certain infectious and noninfectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: To review different literatures that show the association between ABO blood groups and different diseases. METHOD: Original, adequate, and recent articles on the same field were researched, and the researcher conducted a comprehensive review on this topic. Thus, taking out critical discussions, not only a descriptive summary of the topic but also contradictory ideas were fully retrieved and presented in a clear impression. In addition, some relevant scientific papers published in previous years were included. The article search was performed by matching the terms blood types/groups with a group of terms related to different diseases. The articles were screened and selected based on the title and abstract presented. RESULTS: The susceptibility to various diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, infections and hematologic disorders, cognitive disorders, circulatory diseases, metabolic diseases, and malaria, has been linked with ABO blood groups. Moreover, blood group AB individuals were found to be susceptible to an increased risk of cognitive impairment which was independent of geographic region, age, race, and gender. Disorders such as hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes were also more prevalent in individuals with cognitive impairment. Early etiological studies indicated that blood type O has a connection with increased incidence of cholera, plague, tuberculosis infections, and mumps, whereas blood type A is linked with increased incidence of smallpox and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection; blood type B is also associated with increased incidence of gonorrhea, tuberculosis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. coli, and salmonella infections; and blood type AB is associated with increased incidence of smallpox and E. coli and salmonella infections. Diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, arterial hypertension, and family history for ischemic heart disease are the most common risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and can be genetically transmitted to offspring. Higher incidence of cancers in the stomach, ovaries, salivary glands, cervix, uterus, and colon/rectum was common in blood type A people than in O type people. The link between the ABO blood type and thromboembolic diseases and bleeding risk are intervened by the glycosyltransferase activity and plasma levels and biologic activity of vWF (Von Willebrand factor), a carrier protein for coagulation factor VIII which is low in O type. CONCLUSION: Several studies related to the ABO phenotype show that genetically determined human ABO blood groups were correspondingly linked with an increased risk of various infectious and noninfectious diseases. However, further investigations are needed particularly on the molecular level of ABO blood groups and their association with various diseases."
1,Characteristics of pelvic inflammatory disease caused by sexually transmitted disease - An epidemiologic study,10.1016/j.jogoh.2021.102176,"INTRODUCTION: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital organs, diagnosed by clinical findings. The nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) identify sexually transmitted (STD) pathogens from endocervical swabs, via real time PCR. This study explored the prevalence of STD detected by NAAT for women with PID. We also aimed to identify predictive characteristics for positive test. MATERIAL & METHODS: This retrospective cohort study explored the prevalence of positive NAAT for women with clinically diagnosed PID, 2016-2019, in a secondary referral center. The primary outcome was the prevalence of positive STD tests and specific pathogens. The secondary outcome was predictive clinical and laboratory parameters for positive NAAT. RESULTS: Among the 610 women in our cohort, 103 had a positive STD PCR, which accounts for 17%. Most of the patients had Urea parvum (39.4%) Mycoplasma hominis (17.2%) or Urea urealyticum (15.7%). Other pathogens with lower incidence were Chlamydia trachomatis (9.8%), Trichomonas vaginalis (3.4%), Mycoplasma genitalium (2.1%) and the lowest rate was for Neisseria gonorrhea (1.5%). CONCLUSION: In our population, we found lower prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea compared to other large populations. This may be due to a high prevalence of married and religious women and also due to administration of a wide range of empirical antibiotic treatment, even for a low suspicion of PID. The study also gives reassurance that our empirical antibiotic protocol is adjusted to the endemic PID pathogens found in our population."
1,Diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): intra-operative findings and comparison of vaginal and intra-abdominal cultures,10.1007/s00404-014-3150-7,"INTRODUCTION: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is frequent in adolescents and younger women. Diagnosis is usually based on the clinical findings, and the threshold for empiric antibiotic therapy should be low. However, at least in cases of resistance toward therapy or deterioration of symptoms, laparoscopic evaluation can be helpful. METHODS: We searched the hospital charts for in-house patients who were treated for PID or tubo-ovarian abscess between 2007 and 2010. In cases with both vaginal and intra-abdominal bacterial cultures, results of those were compared. RESULTS: 73 patients with suspected PID or tubo-ovarian abscess were included. Median patients' age was 40 years (18-88), 18 of 73 (24.7 %) patients had an IUD at the time of consultation. 58 patients underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy. In 41 patients (70.7 %) tubo-ovarian abscess could be confirmed, four patients had differential gynecologic diagnoses, and two patients appendicitis. In vaginal swabs, most frequent bacteria were Streptococcus sp. (28.5 %), Escherichia coli (22.2 %), Enterococcus faecalis (15.9 %), and Staphylococcus sp. (9.5 %). In eight patients (11 %) Chlamydia trachomatis could be found, there was no case of Neisseria gonorrhea. In 33 patients both vaginal and abdominal cultures were available. In nine cases (27.3 %), identical bacteria could be found, however, 11 cases (33.3 %) showed different results. CONCLUSION: In severe cases of PID, laparoscopic evaluation and taking an intra-abdominal bacterial culture are helpful for the confirmation of diagnosis, accurate microbiologic testing and specific therapy."
1,The role of serological testing for Chlamydia trachomatis in differential diagnosis of pelvic pain,10.5604/12321966.1219196,"INTRODUCTION: Pelvic pain is typically associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The most common cause of PID is Chlamydia trachomatis. The aim of this study was to verify the role of serological testing for Chlamydia trachomatis in patients with suspected PID. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The retrospective study included 185 patients with pelvic pain hospitalized at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2003 and 2004. Titers of anti-Chlamydia trachomatisIgG and IgA were measured by means ELISA immunoassays. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocyte count (WBC) were also determined. Final diagnosis was established on the basis of laparoscopic examination. RESULTS: The presence of anti-Chlamydia trachomatis antibodies correlated significantly with abnormal values of ESR, WBC and CRP. The most common laparoscopic pathology were pelvic adhesions, typically found in women with elevated titers of anti-Chlamydia trachomatis IgG. Cconclusion. Serological examination for Chlamydia trachomatis is helpful in evaluation of patients with suspected PID. Elevated titers of anti-Chlamydia trachomatis antibodies are frequently associated with laparoscopic evidence of pelvic adhesions and inflammation."
1,"Perceived Stress, Sexually Transmitted Infection, and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: Examination of Differences in Associations Among Black and White Women",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001232,"INTRODUCTION: Perceived stress is linked to poor sexual and reproductive health, but its relationship with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is less clear. The elevated burden of stress and STI among Black women suggests a need to examine racial differences in the associations on additive and multiplicative scales. METHODS: Using data from Black and White female participants from wave IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 4744), we examined the association of high stress (scores ≥6 on the Perceived Stress Scale-4) with self-reported past-year chlamydia diagnosis, combined curable STI, and lifetime pelvic inflammatory disease using modified Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate prevalence ratios and prevalence differences. Models included a race-stress product-interaction term and adjusted for sociodemographic variables, prior trauma and stressors, and mental health factors. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, stress was associated with STI among Black and White women. Adjusted associations were attenuated among White women; among Black women, stress remained associated with chlamydia (adjusted prevalence ratio, 2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-3.79) and curable STI (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.40), corresponding to approximately 5 excess cases of each. Among White women, poverty and personality traits were the strongest confounders; among Black women, poverty, trauma, and neurotic personality traits were the strongest confounders for chlamydia, although no factors seemed to confound the association with curable STI. CONCLUSIONS: Stress is independently linked to STI, particularly among Black women. Additional research with longitudinal data is needed to understand the role of stress on STI and address a significant health disparity."
0,Gender Differences in CDC Guideline Compliance for STIs in Emergency Departments,10.5811/westjem.2016.12.32440,"INTRODUCTION: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a common reason for emergency department (ED) visits. The objective of this study was to determine if there were gender differences in adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STI diagnosis and treatment guidelines, as documented by emergency providers. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review to identify patients treated for urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in the EDs of three hospitals in a Pennsylvania network during a calendar year. Cases were reviewed to assess for compliance with CDC guidelines. We used descriptive statistics to assess the distributions of study variables by patient sex. In the analysis we used Student's t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: We identified 286 patient records. Of these, we excluded 39 for the following reasons: incorrect disease coding; the patient was admitted and treated as an inpatient for his/her disease; or the patient left the ED after refusing care. Of the 247 participants, 159 (64.4%) were female. Females were significantly younger (26.6 years, SD=8.0) than males (31.2, SD=11.5%), (95% confidence interval [CI] [2.0- 7.0], p=0.0003). All of the males (n=88) in the cohort presented with urethritis; 25.8% of females presented with cervicitis, and 74.2% with PID. Physician compliance for the five CDC criteria ranged from 68.8% for patient history to 93.5% for patient diagnostic testing, including urine pregnancy and gonorrhea/chlamydia cultures. We observed significant differences by patient sex. Fifty-four percent of the charts had symptoms recorded for female patients that were consistent with CDC characteristics for diagnostic criteria compared to over 95% for males, OR=16.9; 95% CI [5.9-48.4], p<0.001. Similar results were observed for patient discharge instructions, with physicians completely documenting delivery of discharge instructions to 51.6% of females compared to 97.7% of complete documentation in males, OR=42.3; 95% CI [10.0-178.6] p<0.001). We observed no significant sex differences in physician documentation for physical exam or for therapeutic antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study found patient gender differences in how emergency providers complied with documenting with regard to the 2010 CDC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of urethritis, cervicitis, and PID. Specifically medical records of men were more likely to have complete documentation of symptoms recorded (95% CI 5.9-48.4) and to have discharge instruction documentation (95% CI 10.0-178.6) than records of women."
0,Evaluation of VIASURE Sexually Transmitted Diseases Real Time PCR Detection kit (CerTest Biotec) for the diagnostic of sexually transmitted infections,10.1016/j.eimc.2020.04.013,"INTRODUCTION: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common in our environment, and trends have been increasing in the last few years. Different methods for STIs diagnosis have been applied by microbiology laboratories over years, but real-time PCR has improved this process. Our objective was to evaluate VIASURE Sexually Transmitted Diseases Real-Time PCR Detection kit (CerTestBiotec, S.L.) comparing with the real-time PCR technique used in our laboratory (Allplex™ STI7 Essential Assay, Seegene) which was considered as reference assay. METHODS: A total of 948 samples from different sites (vaginal, endocervical, urethral, rectal, pharyngeal swabs and urine samples) were analyzed from July to September 2018. RESULTS: A discordant result was obtained in 4.5% (43 samples). These discrepancies were mainly observed in threshold cycle (Ct) value next to the limit of detection. The k coefficient obtained shows a very high agreement between both methods with k values from 0.92 to 0.99. CONCLUSIONS: VIASURE Sexually Transmitted Diseases Real-Time PCR Detection kit provides a very good correlation with Allplex STI7 and therefore, it's a good tool for the diagnostic of STIs. Positive results with Ct value obtained from 35 and low amplification signal should be applied with caution and should be interpreted based on the patient's clinical data."
0,Investigating point-of-care diagnostics for sexually transmitted infections and antimicrobial resistance in antenatal care in Zimbabwe (IPSAZ): protocol for a  mixed-methods study.,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-070889,"INTRODUCTION: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can cause serious morbidity, including pelvic inflammatory disease, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. In  low/middle-income countries, limited laboratory infrastructure has resulted in a  syndrome-based approach being used for management of STIs, which has poor  sensitivity and specificity, leading to considerable underdiagnosis and  overtreatment. The WHO has called for development and evaluation of strategies to  inform replacement of syndromic management by diagnostic testing.The aim of this  project is to evaluate a strategy of point-of-care testing for six STIs in  antenatal care (ANC) in Zimbabwe. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective  interventional study will be conducted in ANC clinics in Harare province,  Zimbabwe. One thousand pregnant women will be recruited when registering for  routine ANC. Alongside routine HIV and syphilis testing, participants will be  offered an integrated screening package including testing for Chlamydia  trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and  hepatitis B. All individuals with STIs will receive treatment, partner  notification services, risk reduction counselling and referral if needed  according to national guidelines. Gonorrhoea samples will be cultured and tested  for antimicrobial resistance as per WHO enhanced gonococcal antimicrobial  surveillance programme guidelines.The primary outcome measure is the composite  prevalence of CT, NG, TV, syphilis and hepatitis B. A mixed-methods process  evaluation and economic evaluation will be conducted to understand the  acceptability, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of integrated STI testing,  compared with standard of care (syndromic management). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:  The study protocol was approved by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe, the  Biomedical Research and Training Institute Institutional Review Board, and the  London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee. Results  will be submitted to open-access peer-reviewed journals, presented at academic  meetings and shared with participating communities and with national and  international policymaking bodies.

1,Acute pelvic inflammatory disease as a rare cause of acute small bowel obstruction,10.1080/00015458.2018.1453438,"Introduction: Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common presentation to emergency abdominal surgery. The most frequent causes of SBO are congenital, postoperative adhesions, abdominal wall hernia, internal hernia and malignancy. Patients: A 27-year-old woman was hospitalized because of acute abdominal pain, blockage of gases and stools associated with vomiting. Abdominal computed tomography showed an acute small bowel obstruction without any obvious etiology. In view of important abdominal pain and the lack of clear diagnosis, an explorative laparoscopy was performed. Diagnostic of pelvic inflammatory disease was established and was comforted by positive PCR for Chlamydia Trachomatis. Results: Acute small bowel obstruction resulting from acute pelvic inflammatory disease, emerging early after infection, without any clinical or X-ray obvious signs was not described in the literature yet. This infrequent acute SBO etiology but must be searched especially when there is no other evident cause of obstruction in female patients. Early laparoscopy is mostly advised when there are some worrying clinical or CT scan signs."
1,Development of a Chlamydia trachomatis vaccine for urogenital infections: novel tools and new strategies point to bright future prospects,10.1080/14760584.2018.1417044,"INTRODUCTION: The ""cloaked"" bacterial pathogen that is Chlamydia trachomatis continues to cause sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that adversely affect the health and well-being of children, adolescents and adults globally. The reproductive disease sequelae follow unresolved or untreated chronic or recurrent asymptomatic C.trachomatis infections of the lower female genital tract (FGT) and can include pelvic pain, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and ectopic pregnancy. Tubal Factor Infertility (TFI) can also occur since protective and long-term natural immunity to chlamydial infection is incomplete, allowing for ascension of the organism to the upper FGT. Developing countries including the WHO African (8.3 million cases) and South-East Asian regions (7.2 million cases) bear the highest burden of chlamydial STIs. AREAS COVERED: Genetic advances for Chlamydia have provided tools for transformation (including dendrimer-enabled transformation), lateral gene transfer and chemical mutagenesis. Recent progress in these areas is reviewed with a focus on vaccine development for Chlamydia infections of the female genital tract. EXPERT COMMENTARY: A vaccine that can elicit immuno-protective responses whilst avoiding adverse immuno-pathologic host responses is required. The current technological advances in chlamydial genetics and proteomics, as well as novel and improved adjuvants and delivery systems, provide new hope that the elusive chlamydial vaccine is an imminent and realistic goal."
0,[The Neisseria gonorhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis coinfection in patients of Department of Dermatology and Venereology Medical University of Warsaw],,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to investigate the coexistence of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections in patients of Department of Dermatology and Venereology in Warsaw. METHODS: We investigated the urethral, cervical, anal and pharyngeal speci mens from 140 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients of Department of Dermatology and Venereology in Warsaw using the Real-Time PCR method. Real Time PCR DUPLICα® RealTime Neisseria gonorrhoeae and DUPLICα® RealTime Chlamydia trachomatis 2nd Generation Detection Kits (Euroclone®)was performed on termocycler Smart Cycler® Dx. For DNA isolation the Bact Extra Pure Kit (Euroclone®) was used. RESULTS: 22 samples were positive for C. trachomatis and 28 were positive for N. gonorrhoeae. Both infections coexisted in nine patients (6.4%). In our investigations, in opposition to results from other centers, gonorrhoea was more prevalent than C. trachomatis infection. The chlamydial infection coexisted in 32.1% with gonorrhea and gonorrhea coexisted with chlamydial infection in 40.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The coinfection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis occurs very often. According IUSTI and CDC recommendations patients with one kind of sexually transmitted disease (STI) diagnosed should be tested for the others. It is especially true in the case of gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis infection. In IUSTI and CDC recommendations treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis is indicated in patients with gonorrhea."
0,Management of Chlamydia Cases in Australia (MoCCA): protocol for a non-randomised implementation and feasibility trial.,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-067488,"INTRODUCTION: The sexually transmitted infection chlamydia can cause significant complications, particularly among people with female reproductive organs. Optimal  management includes timely and appropriate treatment, notifying and treating  sexual partners, timely retesting for reinfection and detecting complications  including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In Australia, mainstream primary  care (general practice) is where most chlamydia infections are diagnosed, making  it a key setting for optimising chlamydia management. High reinfection and low  retesting rates suggest partner notification and retesting are not uniformly  provided. The Management of Chlamydia Cases in Australia (MoCCA) study seeks to  address gaps in chlamydia management in Australian general practice through  implementing interventions shown to improve chlamydia management in specialist  services. MoCCA will focus on improving retesting, partner management (including  patient-delivered partner therapy) and PID diagnosis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MoCCA  is a non-randomised implementation and feasibility trial aiming to determine how  best to implement interventions to support general practice in delivering best  practice chlamydia management. Our method is guided by the Consolidated Framework  for Implementation Research and the Normalisation Process Theory. MoCCA  interventions include a website, flow charts, fact sheets, mailed specimen kits  and autofills to streamline chlamydia consultation documentation. We aim to  recruit 20 general practices across three Australian states (Victoria, New South  Wales, Queensland) through which we will implement the interventions over 12-18  months. Mixed methods involving qualitative and quantitative data collection and  analyses (observation, interviews, surveys) from staff and patients will be  undertaken to explore our intervention implementation, acceptability and uptake.  Deidentified general practice and laboratory data will be used to measure  pre-post chlamydia testing, retesting, reinfection and PID rates, and to estimate  MoCCA intervention costs. Our findings will guide scale-up plans for Australian  general practice. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from The  University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (Ethics ID: 22665).  Findings will be disseminated via conference presentations, peer-reviewed  publications and study reports."
0,Molecular detection of Mycoplasma genitalium in endocervical swabs and associated rates of macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in Hong Kong,10.12809/hkmj208507,"INTRODUCTION: There is a global trend of increasing macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), such that international guidelines recommend molecular detection of resistance if a patient has MG-positive test results. Tests for MG are not routinely performed in Hong Kong. This study examined the detection of MG in endocervical swabs and the associated macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance rates. METHODS: Endocervical swabs received from two sexual health clinics in Hong Kong for routine assessments of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also subjected to detection of MG. All MG-positive samples were tested for resistance-mediating mutations in 23S rRNA, parC, and gyrA genes. Laboratory records and past results for each patient were analysed. RESULTS: In total, endocervical swabs from 285 patients were included in this study. Mycoplasma genitalium was detected in swabs from 21 patients (7.4%) by real-time polymerase chain reaction with a commercial kit. Among MG-positive samples which were successfully analysed further, macrolide resistance-mediating mutations in 23S rRNA were found in 42.1% (8/19); fluoroquinolone resistance-related mutations in parC and gyrA were found in 65% (13/20) and 0% (0/20), respectively. All macrolide-resistant MG strains were also fluoroquinolone-resistant (42.1%, 8/19). No assessed factors were associated with the detection of MG or resistance-related mutations. CONCLUSION: In Hong Kong, MG was detected in endocervical swabs from 7.4% of patients in sexual health clinics, with high rates of macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance. These findings warrant careful review of testing, clinical correlation, and treatment strategies for MG in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance."
0,Future of human Chlamydia vaccine: potential of self-adjuvanting biodegradable nanoparticles as safe vaccine delivery vehicles,10.1080/14760584.2018.1435279,"INTRODUCTION: There is a persisting global burden and considerable public health challenge by the plethora of ocular, genital and respiratory diseases caused by members of the Gram-negative bacteria of the genus Chlamydia. The major diseases are conjunctivitis and blinding trachoma, non-gonococcal urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, tubal factor infertility, and interstitial pneumonia. The failures in screening and other prevention programs led to the current medical opinion that an efficacious prophylactic vaccine is the best approach to protect humans from chlamydial infections. Unfortunately, there is no human Chlamydia vaccine despite successful veterinary vaccines. A major challenge has been the effective delivery of vaccine antigens to induce safe and effective immune effectors to confer long-term protective immunity. The dawn of the era of biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles and the adjuvanted derivatives may accelerate the realization of the dream of human vaccine in the foreseeable future. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the current status of human chlamydial vaccine research, specifically the potential of biodegradable polymeric nanovaccines to provide efficacious Chlamydia vaccines in the near future. EXPERT COMMENTARY: The safety of biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles-based experimental vaccines with or without adjuvants and the array of available chlamydial vaccine candidates would suggest that clinical trials in humans may be imminent. Also, the promising results from vaccine testing in animal models could lead to human vaccines against trachoma and reproductive diseases simultaneously."
1,Risk of pelvic inflammatory disease after Chlamydia infection in a prospective cohort of sex workers,10.1097/OLQ.0b013e31827b9d75,"INTRODUCTION: There is uncertainty in the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) after chlamydia infection. We analyzed a prospective cohort of sex workers recruited in London between 1985 and 1993 to estimate the risk of PID after a diagnosed case of chlamydia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chlamydia and gonorrhea were defined as ""recent"" if they occurred during the most recent 6 months of follow-up or ""previous"" if they were more than 6 months ago, were the second infection during follow-up, or occurred before the study. Pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed using clinical criteria. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the association between chlamydia and PID controlled for gonorrhea. RESULTS: Three hundred seven women contributed 401.2 person-years of follow-up. The rate of PID in women with recent chlamydia was 27.4 per 100 person-years compared with 11.2 in those without recent chlamydia. Recent and previous chlamydia significantly increased the risk of PID; this association persisted but was no longer significant after controlling for age and history of gonorrhea: recent chlamydia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-5.5), previous chlamydia (aHR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0-3.5), previous gonorrhea (aHR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.6), and age (HR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.9-1.0). DISCUSSION: Women with recent or previous chlamydia are at increased risk for PID. However, this association may be explained by previous exposure to gonorrhea, which was found to increase the risk of PID after a future chlamydia infection."
0,Early microRNA expression profile as a prognostic biomarker for the development of pelvic inflammatory disease in a mouse model of chlamydial genital infection,10.1128/mBio.01241-14,"It is not currently possible to predict the probability of whether a woman with a chlamydial genital infection will develop pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). To determine if specific biomarkers may be associated with distinct chlamydial pathotypes, we utilized two Chlamydia muridarum variants (C. muridarum Var001 [CmVar001] and CmVar004) that differ in their abilities to elicit upper genital tract pathology in a mouse model. CmVar004 has a lower growth rate in vitro and induces pathology in only 20% of C57BL/6 mouse oviducts versus 83.3% of oviducts in CmVar001-infected mice. To determine if chemokine and cytokine production within 24 h of infection is associated with the outcome of pathology, levels of 15 chemokines and cytokines were measured. CmVar004 infection induced significantly lower levels of CXCL1, CXCL2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and CCL2 in comparison to CmVar001 infection with similar rRNA (rs16) levels for Chlamydiae. A combination of microRNA (miRNA) sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of 134 inflammation-related miRNAs was performed 24 h postinfection to determine if the chemokine/cytokine responses would also be reflected in miRNA expression profiles. Interestingly, 12 miRNAs (miR-135a-5p, miR298-5p, miR142-3p, miR223-3p, miR299a-3p, miR147-3p, miR105, miR325-3p, miR132-3p, miR142-5p, miR155-5p, and miR-410-3p) were overexpressed during CmVar004 infection compared to CmVar001 infection, inversely correlating with the respective chemokine/cytokine responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that early biomarkers elicited in the host can differentiate between two pathological variants of chlamydiae and be predictive of upper tract disease. IMPORTANCE: It is apparent that an infecting chlamydial population consists of multiple genetic variants with differing capabilities of eliciting a pathological response; thus, it may be possible to identify biomarkers specific for a given virulence pathotype. miRNAs are known to regulate genes that in turn regulate signaling pathways involved in disease pathogenesis. Importantly, miRNAs are stable and can reflect a tissue response and therefore have the potential to be biomarkers of disease severity. Currently, with respect to chlamydial infections, there is no way to predict whether an infected patient is more or less likely to develop PID. However, data presented in this study indicate that the expression of a specific miRNA profile associated with a virulent variant early in the infection course may be predictive of an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, allowing more aggressive treatment before significant pathology develops."
0,"Reproductive system infections in women: upper genital tract, fetal, neonatal and infant syndromes",10.1093/femspd/ftaa023,"Lower genital tract infection and bloodborne spread of infection are the two principal modes for infection of the upper genital tract or for infection of the fetus, neonate or infant. Treponema pallidum and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are the two most common bloodborne pathogens that infect the fetus, neonate or infant. Most infections of the upper genital tract, however, spread along epithelial surfaces from the vagina or cervix to the upper genital tract or chorioamnion, fetus, neonate or infant. These infections are caused by either pathogens associated with a dysbiotic vaginal microbiome or those that are sexually transmitted. The clinical syndromes that these pathogens produce in the lower genital tract were discussed in part one of this review. We now discuss the syndromes and pathogens that affect the upper genital tract of both non-pregnant and pregnant women as well as fetus, neonate and infant."
0,A case of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma with a Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome-like imaging finding.,10.1007/s12328-023-01770-5,"Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) is a rare disease with a poor prognosis that develops in the mesothelial cells of the peritoneum. We encountered a  48-year-old man with no prior asbestos exposure who visited our hospital with  abdominal pain. Laboratory findings showed elevated C-reactive protein of  15.5 mg/dL. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) detected a  Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome-like contrast effect on the liver surface and  thickening of the peritoneum. Blood culture, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific  IFN-γ release assay, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA testing,  and antinuclear antibody were all negative. CA125 was high at 124.8 U/mL. The  laparoscopy for diagnostic purposes revealed adhesions between the liver surface  and peritoneum in addition to numerous small and large white nodules on the  peritoneum. Biopsy of the nodules confirmed the diagnosis of epithelial-type  MPeM. Treatment was initiated with combined cisplatin and pemetrexed, and CT  6 months later showed a reduced contrast effect on the liver surface and improved  peritoneal thickening. A Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome-like contrast effect on the  liver surface on contrast-enhanced CT may help identify MPeM."
0,Involvement of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in endometrial extracellular matrix turnover in Chlamydia trachomatis-infected recurrent spontaneous aborters,10.1093/femspd/ftx007,"Mechanism underlying Chlamydia trachomatis disease pathology is not completely understood. It was hypothesised that dysregulation of extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) might be involved in sequelae of events leading to abortion in C. trachomatis-infected women. Hence, this study was undertaken to elucidate the expression of MMP-2/MMP-9/TIMP-1/TIMP-3 in infected recurrent spontaneous aborters (RSA) and simultaneously ascertain effect of few cytokines (TNF-α, TGF-β1, TGF-β2)/cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) on MMPs. Endometrial curettage tissue was collected from 135 RSA (group I) and 120 age-matched controls (group II) at Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, SJH, New Delhi (India). PCR was performed for diagnosis of C. trachomatis MOMP/plasmid gene. Expression of MMP-2/MMP-9/TIMP-1/TIMP-3 mRNA was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Data were statistically evaluated. 15.6% (n = 21) RSA (Group-I) were diagnosed as C. trachomatis positive. Significant upregulation of MMP-2/MMP-9 and decreased TIMP-1/TIMP-3 were found in C. trachomatis-positive RSA (group I) versus control women (group II). MMP-2 was found positively correlated with cytokines/Cox-2. Significant positive correlation was observed between MMP-2/MMP-9 and C. trachomatis copy load. Overall data suggested that dysregulated MMPs/TIMPs promoted excessive endometrial matrix degradation which, in turn, affected pregnancy leading to spontaneous abortion in infected women."

In the retrospective cross-sectional assessment  presented here, the quantitative dimension of infection or colonization with  selected resistant or pathogenic bacteria and parasites was regionally assessed.  To do so, 274 collected placental tissues from Ivory Coastal and Ghanaian women  were subjected to selective growth of resistant bacteria, as well as to molecular  screening for beta-lactamase genes, Schistosoma spp. and selected bacterial  causative agents of sexually transmitted infections (STI).  Panton-Valentine-negative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was  grown from 1.8% of the tissue samples, comprising the spa types t008 and t688, as  well as the newly detected ones, t12101 (n = 2) and t12102. While the  culture-based recovery of resistant Enterobacterales and nonfermentative  rod-shaped Gram-negative bacteria failed, molecular assessments confirmed  beta-lactamase genes in 31.0% of the samples with multiple detections of up to  four resistance genes per sample and bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP), bla(GES), bla(VIM),  bla(OXA-58)-like, bla(NDM), bla(OXA-23)-like, bla(OXA-48)-like and bla(KPC)  occurring in descending order of frequency. The beta-lactamase genes  bla(OXA-40/24)-like, bla(NMC_A/IMI), bla(BIC), bla(SME), bla(GIM) and bla(DIM)  were not detected. DNA of the urogenital schistosomiasis-associated Schistosoma  haematobium complex was recorded in 18.6% of the samples, but only a single  positive signal for S. mansoni with a high cycle-threshold value in real-time PCR  was found. Of note, higher rates of schistosomiasis were observed in Ghana (54.9%  vs. 10.3% in Ivory Coast) and Cesarean section was much more frequent in  schistosomiasis patients (61.9% vs. 14.8% in women without Schistosoma spp. DNA  in the placenta). Nucleic acid sequences of  nonlymphogranuloma-venereum-associated Chlamydia trachomatis and of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae were recorded in 1.1% and 1.9% of the samples, respectively, while  molecular attempts to diagnose Treponema pallidum and Mycoplasma genitalium did  not lead to positive results. Molecular detection of Schistosoma spp. or  STI-associated pathogens was only exceptionally associated with multiple  resistance gene detections in the same sample, suggesting epidemiological  distinctness. In conclusion, the assessment confirmed considerable prevalence of  urogenital schistosomiasis and resistant bacterial colonization, as well as a  regionally expected abundance of STI-associated pathogens. Continuous screening  offers seem advisable to minimize the risks for the pregnant women and their  newborns."
0,Preclinical Testing of Vaccines and Therapeutics for Gonorrhea in Female Mouse Models of Lower and Upper Reproductive Tract Infection,10.1093/infdis/jiab211,"Murine models of Neisseria gonorrhoeae lower reproductive tract infection are valuable systems for studying N. gonorrhoeae adaptation to the female host and immune responses to infection. These models have also accelerated preclinical testing of candidate therapeutic and prophylactic products against gonorrhea. However, because N. gonorrhoeae infection is restricted to the murine cervicovaginal region, there is a need for an in vivo system for translational work on N. gonorrhoeae pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Here we discuss the need for well-characterized preclinical upper reproductive tract infection models for developing candidate products against N. gonorrhoeae PID, and report a refinement of the gonorrhea mouse model that supports sustained upper reproductive tract infection. To establish this new model for vaccine testing, we also tested the licensed meningococcal 4CMenB vaccine, which cross-protects against murine N. gonorrhoeae lower reproductive tract infection, for efficacy against N. gonorrhoeae in the endometrium and oviducts following transcervical or vaginal challenge."

If misdiagnosed and left untreated,  this newer, emerging sexually transmitted infection (STI) can cause complications  such as urethritis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in both men and women.  In males, MG can be asymptomatic and undetectable. In females, MG may present  with nonspecific symptoms, such as dysuria, vaginal discharge, and/or pelvic  pain. In addition to chlamydia and gonorrhea, MG may result in PID. Due to the  complications of MG, health care providers in the emergency department setting  need to consider this as a differential diagnosis when performing STI and  vaginitis screenings on sexually active patients who may present with urinary or  vaginal complaints. As patients with pelvic pain are frequently seen in the  emergency department, providers need to be aware of the role that MG may play in  STIs and the subsequent sequelae if not treated properly."
0,Mycoplasma genitalium: A new superbug,10.4103/ijstd.ijstd_103_20,"Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) is an emerging sexually transmitted pathogen. It is an important cause of nongonococcal urethritis in men and is associated with cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease in women, putting them at risk of infertility. Multiple factors that aid pathogenesis of MG include its ability of adhesion, gliding motility, and intracellular invasion by means of the tip organelle. Through intracellular localization and antigenic variation, MG could result in treatment-resistant chronic infection. There are limited data on the prevalence of MG in Indian patients with urogenital syndromes. Recently, a high prevalence of extra genital infection with MG has been reported. Molecular assays are the major diagnostic techniques of MG infection. Antimicrobial agents such as macrolides, along with fluoroquinolones, are the treatment of choice for MG infections. The issue of drug resistance to azithromycin and fluoroquinolones in MG is rising globally. As molecular tests are becoming available for MG, both for the diagnosis and the detection of antimicrobial resistance, any patient with MG infection should then be tested for antimicrobial resistance. Consideration of MG as a cause of sexually transmitted disease in the Indian population is crucial in diagnostic algorithms and treatment strategies. The purpose of this review is to understand the prevalence of MG in different clinical scenarios, molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, current status of antimicrobial resistance, and its impact on MG treatment."
0,2021 European guideline on the management of Mycoplasma genitalium infections,10.1111/jdv.17972,"Mycoplasma genitalium infection contributes to 10-35% of non-chlamydial non-gonococcal urethritis in men. In women, M. genitalium is associated with cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in 10-25%. Transmission of M. genitalium occurs through direct mucosal contact. CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS: Asymptomatic infections are frequent. In men, urethritis, dysuria and discharge predominate. In women, symptoms include vaginal discharge, dysuria or symptoms of PID - abdominal pain and dyspareunia. Symptoms are the main indication for diagnostic testing. Diagnosis is achievable only through nucleic acid amplification testing and must include investigation for macrolide resistance mutations. THERAPY: Therapy for M .genitalium is indicated if M. genitalium is detected. Doxycycline has a cure rate of 30-40%, but resistance is not increasing. Azithromycin has a cure rate of 85-95% in macrolide-susceptible infections. An extended course of azithromycin appears to have a higher cure rate, and pre-treatment with doxycycline may decrease organism load and the risk of macrolide resistance selection. Moxifloxacin can be used as second-line therapy but resistance is increasing. RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Uncomplicated M. genitalium infection without macrolide resistance mutations or resistance testing: Azithromycin 500 mg on day one, then 250 mg on days 2-5 (oral). Second-line treatment and treatment for uncomplicated macrolide-resistant M. genitalium infection: Moxifloxacin 400 mg od for 7 days (oral). Third-line treatment for persistent M. genitalium infection after azithromycin and moxifloxacin: Doxycycline or minocycline 100 mg bid for 14 days (oral) may cure 40-70%. Pristinamycin 1 g qid for 10 days (oral) has a cure rate of around 75%. Complicated M. genitalium infection (PID, epididymitis): Moxifloxacin 400 mg od for 14 days. MAIN CHANGES FROM THE 2016 EUROPEAN M. GENITALIUM GUIDELINE: Due to increasing antimicrobial resistance and warnings against moxifloxacin use, indications for testing and treatment have been narrowed to primarily involve symptomatic patients. The importance of macrolide resistance-guided therapy is emphasised."
1,[Mycoplasma genitalium probably as common in Sweden as Chlamydia trachomatis],,"Mycoplasma genitalium is a common sexually transmitted infection, probably as common in Swedish STI clinics as Chlamydia trachomatis. M. genitalium may cause urethritis in men and and urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility in women. The proportion of PID and its implications need further studies. The prevalence of M. genitalium infection in a general population and in asymptomatic patients is estimated to be low and general screening is not recommended. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) including resistance testing for macrolides are available in Sweden. The first-line treatment in the absence of macrolide resistance is with azithromycin, but not as a single dose. Pretreatment with doxycycline to lower bacterial load and reduce risk of macrolide resistance during treatment is under discussion."
0,Mycoplasma genitalium: An Overlooked Sexually Transmitted Pathogen in Women?,10.1155/2016/4513089,"Mycoplasma genitalium is a facultative anaerobic organism and a recognized cause of nongonococcal urethritis in men. In women, M. genitalium has been associated with cervicitis, endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and adverse birth outcomes, indicating a consistent relationship with female genital tract pathology. The global prevalence of M. genitalium among symptomatic and asymptomatic sexually active women ranges between 1 and 6.4%. M. genitalium may play a role in pathogenesis as an independent sexually transmitted pathogen or by facilitating coinfection with another pathogen. The long-term reproductive consequences of M. genitalium infection in asymptomatic individuals need to be investigated further. Though screening for this pathogen is not currently recommended, it should be considered in high-risk populations. Recent guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control regarding first-line treatment for PID do not cover M. genitalium but recommend considering treatment in patients without improvement on standard PID regimens. Prospective studies on the prevalence, pathophysiology, and long-term reproductive consequences of M. genitalium infection in the general population are needed to determine if screening protocols are necessary. New treatment regimens need to be investigated due to increasing drug resistance."
0,Microbial and vaginal determinants influencing Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum genital colonization in a population of female patients,,"Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum are associated with chorioamnionitis, preterm delivery and pelvic inflammatory disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible risk factors of co-colonization by M. hominis in patients already colonized by U. urealyticum and compare demographic parameters, vaginal pH and microbiota of women colonized by U. urealyticum or M. hominis. A total of 452 patients positive for U. urealyticum or M. hominis were analysed, 421 (93.1%) of whom were positive for U. urealyticum and 31 (6.9%) for M. hominis. Patients positive for M. hominis compared to patients positive for U. urealyticum were more frequently colonized by Gardnerella vaginalis (71% vs 18.5%; p 0.0001), less frequently by lactobacilli (16.1% vs 61.5%; p 0.0001), and more frequently had a pH value higher than 4.5 (96.8% vs 57%; p 0.0001), all conditions associated to bacterial vaginosis (BV). Logistic regression analysis showed that only G. vaginalis colonization and pH higher than 4.5 were independently related to M. hominis colonization (respectively p 0.0001 and p 0.016). Thus, in women colonized by U. urealyticum, BV is an independent risk factor for M. hominis co-colonization."
1,Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma infection in pregnancy: to screen or not to screen,10.1515/jpm-2016-0111,"Mycoplasmata have been linked to pregnancy complications and neonatal risk. While formerly a limited number of species could be discovered by cultures, molecular biology nowadays discovers both lower quantities and more diverse species, making us realize that mycoplasmata are ubiquitous in the vaginal milieu and do not always pose a danger for pregnant women. As the meaning of mycoplasmata in pregnancy is not clear to many clinicians, we summarized the current knowledge about the meaning of different kinds of mycoplasmata in pregnancy and discuss the potential benefits and disadvantages of treatment. Currently, there is no general rule to screen and treat for mycoplasmata in pregnancy. New techniques seem to indicate that Ureaplasma parvum (Up), which now can be distinguished from U. urealyticum (Uu), may pose an increased risk for preterm birth and bronchopulmonary disease in the preterm neonate. Mycoplasma hominis (Mh) is related to early miscarriages and midtrimester abortions, especially in the presence of abnormal vaginal flora. Mycoplasma genitalium (Mg) is now recognized as a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that is involved in the causation of cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in non-pregnant, and preterm birth and miscarriages in pregnant women, irrespective of the presence of concurrent other STIs, like Chlamydia or gonorrhoea. Proper studies to test for efficacy and improved pregnancy outcome are scarce and inconclusive. Azythromycin is the standard treatment now, although, for Mg, this may not be sufficient. The role of clarithromycin in clinical practice still has to be established. There is a stringent need for new studies based on molecular diagnostic techniques and randomized treatment protocols with promising and safe antimicrobials."
0,Immune responses to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and implications for vaccine development.,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1248613,"Neisseria gonorrheoae is the causative agent of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted infection responsible for a major burden of disease with a high global  prevalence. Protective immunity to infection is often not observed in humans,  possible due to high variability of key antigens, induction of blocking  antibodies, or a large number of infections being relatively superficial and not  inducing a strong immune response. N. gonorrhoeae is a strictly human pathogen,  however, studies using mouse models provide useful insights into the immune  response to gonorrhea. In mice, N. gonorrhoea appears to avoid a protective Th1  response by inducing a less protective Th17 response. In mouse models, candidate  vaccines which provoke a Th1 response can accelerate the clearance of gonococcus  from the mouse female genital tract. Human studies indicate that natural  infection often induces a limited immune response, with modest antibody  responses, which may correlate with the clinical severity of gonococcal disease.  Studies of cytokine responses to gonococcal infection in humans provide  conflicting evidence as to whether infection induces an IL-17 response. However,  there is evidence for limited induction of protective immunity from a study of  female sex workers in Kenya. A controlled human infection model (CHIM) has been  used to examine the immune response to gonococcal infection in male volunteers,  but has not to date demonstrated protection against re-infection. Correlates of  protection for gonorrhea are lacking, which has hampered the progress towards  developing a successful vaccine. However, the finding that the Neisseria  meningitidis serogroup B vaccines, elicit cross-protection against gonorrhea has  invigorated the gonococcal vaccine field. More studies of infection in humans,  either natural infection or CHIM studies, are needed to understand better  gonococcal protective immunity."

0,Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes as a Novel Treatment for Female Infertility Caused by Bacterial Infections,10.3389/fmicb.2021.785649,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are the most common causes of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) with complications in women, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. The main concern with these infections is that 70% of infected women are asymptomatic and these infections ascend to the upper female reproductive tract (FRT). Primary infection in epithelial cells creates a cascade of events that leads to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that stimulate innate immunity. Production of various cytokines is damaging to mucosal barriers, and tissue destruction leads to ciliated epithelial destruction that is associated with tubal scarring and ultimately provides the conditions for infertility. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known as tissue specific stem cells with limited self-renewal capacity and the ability to repair damaged tissues in a variety of pathological conditions due to their multipotential differentiation capacity. Moreover, MSCs secrete exosomes that contain bioactive factors such as proteins, lipids, chemokines, enzymes, cytokines, and immunomodulatory factors which have therapeutic properties to enhance recovery activity and modulate immune responses. Experimental studies have shown that local and systemic treatment of MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) suppresses the destructive immune response due to the delivery of immunomodulatory proteins. Interestingly, some recent data have indicated that MSC-Exos display strong antimicrobial effects, by the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs), and increase bacterial clearance by enhancing the phagocytic activity of host immune cells. Considering MSC-Exos can secrete different bioactive factors that can modulate the immune system and prevent infection, exosome therapy is considered as a new therapeutic method in the treatment of inflammatory and microbial diseases. Here we intend to review the possible application of MSC-Exos in female reproductive system bacterial diseases."
0,Repurposing Carbamazepine To Treat Gonococcal Infection in Women: Oral Delivery for Control of Epilepsy Generates Therapeutically Effective Levels in Vaginal  Secretions.,10.1128/aac.00968-22,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to all previous antibiotics used for treatment. This highlights a crucial need for novel antimicrobials to treat  gonococcal infections. We previously showed that carbamazepine (Cz), one of the  most commonly prescribed antiepileptic drugs, can block the interaction between  gonococcal pili and the I-domain region of human complement receptor 3 (CR3)-an  interaction that is vital for infection of the female cervix. We also show that  Cz can completely clear an established N. gonorrhoeae infection of primary human  cervical cells. In this study, we quantified Cz in serum, saliva, and vaginal  fluid collected from 16 women who were, or were not, regularly taking Cz. We  detected Cz in lower reproductive tract mucosal secretions in the test group  (women taking Cz) at potentially therapeutic levels using a competitive ELISA.  Furthermore, we found that Cz concentrations present in vaginal fluid from women  taking this drug were sufficient to result in a greater than 99% reduction  (within 24 h) in the number of viable gonococci recovered from ex vivo, human,  primary cervical cell infections. These data provide strong support for the  further development of Cz as a novel, host-targeted therapy to treat gonococcal  cervicitis."
0,Transcriptome Analysis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae during Natural Infection Reveals Differential Expression of Antibiotic Resistance Determinants between Men and Women,10.1128/mSphereDirect.00312-18,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a bacterial pathogen responsible for the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of N. gonorrhoeae worldwide has resulted in limited therapeutic choices for this infection. Men who seek treatment often have symptomatic urethritis; in contrast, gonococcal cervicitis in women is usually minimally symptomatic, but may progress to pelvic inflammatory disease. Previously, we reported the first analysis of gonococcal transcriptome expression determined in secretions from women with cervical infection. Here, we defined gonococcal global transcriptional responses in urethral specimens from men with symptomatic urethritis and compared these with transcriptional responses in specimens obtained from women with cervical infections and in vitro-grown N. gonorrhoeae isolates. This is the first comprehensive comparison of gonococcal gene expression in infected men and women. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that 9.4% of gonococcal genes showed increased expression exclusively in men and included genes involved in host immune cell interactions, while 4.3% showed increased expression exclusively in women and included phage-associated genes. Infected men and women displayed comparable antibiotic-resistant genotypes and in vitro phenotypes, but a 4-fold higher expression of the Mtr efflux pump-related genes was observed in men. These results suggest that expression of AMR genes is programed genotypically and also driven by sex-specific environments. Collectively, our results indicate that distinct N. gonorrhoeae gene expression signatures are detected during genital infection in men and women. We propose that therapeutic strategies could target sex-specific differences in expression of antibiotic resistance genes.IMPORTANCE Recent emergence of antimicrobial resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae worldwide has resulted in limited therapeutic choices for treatment of infections caused by this organism. We performed global transcriptomic analysis of N. gonorrhoeae in subjects with gonorrhea who attended a Nanjing, China, sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic, where antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae is high and increasing. We found that N. gonorrhoeae transcriptional responses to infection differed in genital specimens taken from men and women, particularly antibiotic resistance gene expression, which was increased in men. These sex-specific findings may provide a new approach to guide therapeutic interventions and preventive measures that are also sex specific while providing additional insight to address antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae."
0,Glycointeractome of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Identification of Host Glycans Targeted by the Gonococcus To Facilitate Adherence to Cervical and Urethral Epithelial Cells,10.1128/mBio.01339-19,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a significant threat to global health for which a vaccine and novel treatment options are urgently needed. Glycans expressed by human cells are commonly targeted by pathogens to facilitate interactions with the host, and thus characterization of these interactions can aid identification of bacterial receptors that can be exploited as vaccine and/or drug targets. Using glycan array analysis, we identified 247 specific interactions between N. gonorrhoeae and glycans representative of those found on human cells. Interactions included those with mannosylated, fucosylated, and sialylated glycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and glycans terminating with galactose (Gal), N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). By investigating the kinetics of interactions with selected glycans, we demonstrate that whole-cell N. gonorrhoeae has a high affinity for mannosylated glycans (dissociation constant [KD ], 0.14 to 0.59 μM), which are expressed on the surface of cervical and urethral epithelial cells. Using chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric (MS) analysis, we identified potential mannose-binding proteins in N. gonorrhoeae Pretreatment of cells with mannose-specific lectin (concanavalin A) or free mannose competitor (α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside) substantially reduced gonococcal adherence to epithelial cells. This suggests that N. gonorrhoeae targets mannosyl glycans to facilitate adherence to host cells and that mannosides or similar compounds have the potential to be used as a novel treatment option for N. gonorrhoeaeIMPORTANCE Multidrug-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are emerging worldwide, and novel treatment and prevention strategies are needed. Glycans are ubiquitously expressed by all human cells and can be specifically targeted by pathogens to facilitate association with host cells. Here we identify and characterize the N. gonorrhoeae host-glycan binding profile (glycointeractome), which revealed numerous interactions, including high-affinity binding to mannosyl glycans. We identify gonococcal potential mannose-binding proteins and show that N. gonorrhoeae uses mannosyl glycans expressed on the surface of cervical and urethral epithelia to facilitate adherence. Furthermore, a mannose-binding lectin or a mannoside compound was able to reduce this adherence. By characterizing the glycointeractome of N. gonorrhoeae, we were able to elucidate a novel mechanism used by this important pathogen to interact with human cells, and this interaction could be exploited to develop novel therapeutics to treat antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea."

This ancient human disease remains a serious problem, occurring at high incidence globally and having a major impact on reproductive and neonatal health. N. gonorrhoeae is rapidly evolving into a superbug and no effective vaccine exists to prevent gonococcal infections. Untreated or inadequately treated gonorrhea can lead to severe sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women, epididymitis in men, and sight-threatening conjunctivitis in infants born to infected mothers. Therefore, there is an immediate need for accelerated research toward the identification of molecular targets for development of drugs with new mechanisms of action and preventive vaccine(s). Global proteomic approaches are ideally suited to guide these studies. Recent quantitative proteomics (SILAC, iTRAQ, and ICAT) have illuminated the pathways utilized by N. gonorrhoeae to adapt to different lifestyles and micro-ecological niches within the host, while comparative 2D SDS-PAGE analysis has been used to elucidate spectinomycin resistance mechanisms. Further, high-throughput examinations of cell envelopes and naturally released membrane vesicles have unveiled the ubiquitous and differentially expressed proteins between temporally and geographically diverse N. gonorrhoeae isolates. This review will focus on these different approaches, emphasizing the role of proteomics in the search for vaccine candidates. Although our knowledge of N. gonorrhoeae has been expanded, still far less is known about this bacterium than the closely related N. meningitidis, where genomics- and proteomics-driven studies have led to the successful development of vaccines."

When the disease presents, it may appear in the form of acute abdomen and normal imaging tests, making it a major diagnostic challenge. We present four cases of acute gonococcal peritonitis. The main symptom was acute abdominal pain, and both the gy-necological examination and complementary tests showed normal results. The only notable finding from the laparoscopy was the existence of purulent ascitic fluid. The results of the anatomical and pathological tests were all normal. Endocer-vical and ascitic fluid culture showed infection with N. gonorrhoeae, and in one case, concomitant infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. The definitive treatment applied was intravenous antibiotic therapy. When a sexually active young woman is diagnosed with peritonitis that has no apparent cause, it is important to rule out sexually transmitted diseases."

Urban AYAs 13-25 years assigned female sex at birth with acute mild-moderate PID provided baseline and follow-up interview data and vaginal specimens for sexually transmitted infection (STI), cytokine, and microbiota assessment. All participants received medications and text-messaging support. Participants were block randomized to either control or intervention. Control participants received 1 community nursing visit with self-management for interim care per national guidelines. Intervention participants received unlimited precision care services driven by interim STI and macrolide resistance testing results by an advanced practice provider.

Of the participants, 94% completed the intervention and 96%, 91%, and 89%, respectively, completed their 14-, 30-, and 90-day visits. Baseline laboratory results revealed infection rates that were highest for Mycoplasma genitalium (45%) followed by Chlamydia trachomatis (31%).

To identify the prevalence of co-infection, we included 189 women with suspicion of HPV. Viral typing was performed by carrying out the Roche HP Linear Array test, while CT detection was performed with the COBAS® TaqMan® 48 kit from Roche. Of the 189 women only 184 had an infection with HPV, CT or both: 56.6% were positive for one or several HPV genotypes, and 67.7% for CT. Clinical data showed an association between HPV and CIN I (n = 22; RR = 2.43; 95% CI 1.72-3.43, p < 0.05). CT infection was only associated with cervicitis (n = 40; RR = 1.73; 95% CI 1.34-2.23, p < 0.05). The CT-HPV co-infection rate was 28%.

0,GrpE Immunization Protects Against Ureaplasma urealyticum Infection in BALB/C Mice,10.3389/fimmu.2020.01495,"Nucleotide exchange factor (GrpE), a highly conserved antigen, is rapidly expressed and upregulated when Ureaplasma urealyticum infects a host, which could act as a candidative vaccine if it can induce an anti-U. urealyticum immune reaction. Here, we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant GrpE protein adjuvanted by Freund's adjuvant (FA), to protect against U. urealyticum genital tract infection in a mouse model. After booster immunization in mice with FA, the GrpE can induced both humoral and cellular immune response after intramuscular injection into BALB/c mice. A strong humoral immune response was detected in the GrpE-immunized mice characterized by production of high titers of antigen-specific serum IgG (IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG3) antibodies. At the same time, the GrpE also induced a Th1-biased cytokine spectrum with high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α after re-stimulation with immunogen GrpE in vitro, suggesting that GrpE could trigger the Th1 response when used for vaccination in the presence of FA. Although GrpE vaccination in the presence of a Th1-type adjuvant-induced had readily detectable Th1 responses, there wasn't increase inflammation in response to the infection. More importantly, the robust immune responses in mice after immunization with GrpE showed a significantly reduced U. urealyticum burden in cervical tissues. Histopathological analysis confirmed that tissues of GrpE-immunized BALB/c mice were protected against the pathological effects of U. urealyticum infection.

UTILISATEURS CONCERNéS: Médecins, y compris les gynécologues, obstétriciens, médecins de famille, urgentologues; infirmières, y compris les infirmières autorisées et les infirmières praticiennes; sages-femmes, y compris les sages-femmes en pratique clinique et les apprenties sages-femmes et les apprentis en médecine, y compris les étudiants de médecine, résidents, stagiaires (fellows); et tous les autres fournisseurs de soins de santé qui prodiguent des soins aux femmes. POPULATION CIBLE: La présente publication fournit des données probantes et des recommandations fondées sur des avis d'experts sur l'examen pelvien chez les femmes adultes (18 ans et plus) avec et sans symptômes gynécologiques. ISSUES: La présente publication clarifie les indications de l'examen pelvien dans le contexte des déclarations de groupes d'étude nationaux récemment publiées sur l'utilité de l'examen pelvien. L'objectif est de veiller à ce que les femmes qui présentent des indications cliniques d'examen fassent rapidement l'objet d'une évaluation clinique adéquate pour diagnostiquer les maladies traitables. DONNÉES PROBANTES: Pour la présente opinion de comité, les études pertinentes ont été repérées dans PubMed et Medline à l'aide des termes suivants, seuls ou combinés, et les recherches ont été limitées aux publications en anglais portant sur des humains sans date limite de publication : pelvic examination, bimanual examination, speculum examination, rectovaginal examination, ovarian cancer screening, asymptomatic women, periodic health examination. La recherche a été effectuée en mai et en juin 2018. Les données probantes pertinentes ont été retenues dans l'ordre suivant : méta-analyses, revues systématiques, lignes directrices et déclarations des groupes d'étude nationaux, essais cliniques randomisés, études de cohorte prospective, études observationnelles, revues non systématiques, études de série de cas et rapports. Des articles supplémentaires ont été repérés en consultant les notices bibliographiques des publications sélectionnées. Une revue systématique officielle n'a pas été menée pour tous les sujets discutés en raison du manque de données probantes et du nombre de différents sous-thèmes abordés. Le nombre total de publications examinées dans le cadre de cette revue était de 66. MÉTHODES DE VALIDATION: Les auteurs principaux ont rédigé le contenu et les recommandations et ils se sont entendus sur ces derniers. Les conseils d'administration de la Society of Gynecologic Oncology of Canada (GOC), de Collège des médecins de famille du Canada (CMFC) et de la Société des obstétriciens et gynécologues du Canada (SOGC) ont approuvé la version définitive aux fins de publication après que leurs comités représentatifs respectifs l'aient passée en revue. La qualité des données probantes utilisées dans le présent document a été évaluée au moyen des critères du cadre méthodologique GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). (Tableaux 1 et 2) Le résumé des conclusions est disponible sur demande. AVANTAGES, PRÉJUDICE ET COÛTS: La présente opinion de comité devrait aider toutes les femmes qui souffrent ou non de symptômes gynécologiques qui se présentent chez le gynécologue et un fournisseur de soins primaires. Elle aidera les praticiens à déterminer les indications d'examen pelvien afin de réduire le nombre d'examens inutiles et susceptibles de porter préjudice tout en augmentant le nombre d'examens indiqués afin de réduire les retards de diagnostic des affections gynécologiques traitables. MISE À JOUR DE LA DIRECTIVE CLINIQUE: La présente opinion de comité de la SOGC sera automatiquement passée en revue cinq ans après sa publication pour déterminer si une partie ou l'ensemble de l'opinion de comité devrait être mis à jour. Cependant, cette revue peut être effectuée plus tôt si de nouvelles recherches révolutionnaires sont publiées entre-temps. DÉCLARATIONS SOMMAIRES: 1) Les déclarations et les directives nationales et internationales sur l'examen pelvien ne devraient pas être interprétées comme si l'examen pelvien est superflu, qu'il ne contribue pas à l’évaluation physique ou que l'examen pelvien chez les femmes symptomatiques devrait être omis. 2) L'examen pelvien peut comprendre les examens visuels, au spéculum, bimanuel, à un doigt ou rectovaginal selon l'indication d'examen. 3) Aucune étude publiée à ce jour n'a évalué adéquatement quelque composante que ce soit de l'examen pelvien comme méthode de dépistage pour quelconque type de maladie gynécologique maligne, à l'exception de l'examen au spéculum pour le dépistage cytologique du cancer du col de l'utérus. Ainsi, toute recommandation universelle, pour ou contre les examens pelviens pour d'autres indications ne peut qu’être faite selon l'opinion des spécialistes et des données probantes de faible qualité. 4) Chez les femmes asymptomatiques dont le risque de cancer du col de l'utérus est moyen, le dépistage cytologique du cancer du col de l'utérus réduit à la fois son incidence et son taux de mortalité en détectant les lésions préinvasives traitables. 5) Chez les femmes asymptomatiques dont le risque de tumeur ou affection maligne est moyen, un examen visuel et bimanuel au moment d'obtenir des échantillons cytologiques cervicaux peut apporter une valeur ajoutée à cette méthode de dépistage. Les femmes peuvent ne pas soulever certaines inquiétudes sur le plan gynécologique jusqu'au moment de l'examen pelvien; l'examen offre une occasion de sensibiliser les patientes et de maintenir les compétences du praticien; de plus, même si le sujet n'a pas encore été étudié adéquatement, il pourrait comporter des effets positifs sur les tumeurs ou affections malignes ovariennes et vulvaires qui nécessiteraient des analyses plus poussées. Ces avantages potentiels devraient être soupesés par rapport aux préjudices potentiels comme l'inconfort de la patiente et les faux positifs ou négatifs qui pourraient la rassurer à tort ou entraîner des analyses et des interventions non justifiées. RECOMMANDATIONS: Femmes symptomatiques 1) Toute femme qui exprime des plaintes de nature gynécologique, y compris, mais sans s'y limiter, des plaintes concernant la vulve, des pertes vaginales, des saignements préménopausiques anormaux, des saignements postménopausiques, l'infertilité, des symptômes de prolapsus des organes pelviens, l'incontinence urinaire, de nouveaux symptômes gastro-intestinaux inexpliqués (douleur abdominale, distension abdominale ou ballonnement et difficulté à manger ou satiété précoce), la douleur pelvienne ou la dyspareunie, devrait subir des composantes pertinentes de l'examen pelvien afin de détecter les maladies bénignes ou malignes (forte, basse). 2) Les fournisseurs de soins de santé peuvent envisager de discuter des risques et avantages de l'exécution d'un examen pelvien de base qui comprend un examen visuel et un examen bimanuel avant de prescrire une hormonothérapie substitutive ou un traitement hormonal de la ménopause (faible, très basse). Femmes asymptomatiques 3) Les professionnels de la santé devraient faire le dépistage cytologique du cancer du col de l'utérus conformément aux lignes directrices provinciales ou territoriales (forte, forte). 4) Les données sont insuffisantes pour orienter les recommandations sur l'examen pelvien aux fins de dépistage de tumeurs ou affections malignes de nature gynécologique non cervicales ou de toute maladie gynécologique bénigne chez les femmes asymptomatiques en santé dont le risque de tumeur ou affection maligne est moyen. Cependant, les professionnels de la santé peuvent envisager d'effectuer un examen pelvien aux fins de dépistage comprenant les examens visuel, bimanuel et au spéculum conjointement avec le prélèvement d’échantillons cytologiques cervicaux selon les intervalles recommandés dans les lignes directrices provinciales ou territoriales. Cette pratique pourrait permettre de détecter d'importantes maladies bénignes ou malignes non reconnues ou signalées par la patiente (faible, très basse). 5) Chez les femmes âgées de plus de 70 ans qui n'ont plus à subir de dépistage cytologique cervical, les professionnels de la santé devraient envisager de continuer chez les femmes asymptomatiques le dépistage périodique des maladies vulvaires en examinant la vulve, le périnée et l'anus afin de détecter les maladies bénignes ou malignes méconnues de cette population. Les données sont insuffisantes pour déterminer des recommandations sur la fréquence de cet examen (faible, basse). 6) Des examens pelviens de dépistage plus fréquents pour déceler les signes précoces de tumeurs ou affections malignes primitives, récidivantes ou métastatiques en l'absence de symptômes pourraient s'avérer bénéfiques pour les femmes qui ont des antécédents personnels de tumeurs malignes de nature gynécologique, un diagnostic génétique qui augmente le risque de tumeurs ou affections malignes gynécologiques ou des antécédents d'exposition in utero au diéthylstilbestrol. Puisque les données pour déterminer ces intervalles de dépistage sont inadéquates, on devrait les déterminer en fonction des lignes directrices provinciales ou territoriales et de l'opinion des spécialistes (faible, très basse). 7) Les options non effractives et par auto-prélèvement de dépistage de la chlamydia et de la gonorrhée sont acceptables chez les femmes asymptomatiques, mais l'examen pelvien, qui comprend les examens visuel, bimanuel et au spéculum, est requis en présence de symptômes pour écarter la possibilité d'une maladie inflammatoire pelvienne ou d'un abcès tubo-ovarien (forte, basse). 8) Aucun examen pelvien n'est requis avant la prescription de contraception hormonale chez une femme en santé qui ne présente aucun symptôme gynécologique (forte, basse)."
1,Risk factors for Mycoplasma genitalium endometritis and incident infection: a secondary data analysis of the T cell Response Against Chlamydia (TRAC) Study,10.1136/sextrans-2017-053376,"OBJECTIVE: Assess risk factors for incident and endometrial Mycoplasma genitalium infection and determine if M. genitalium is associated with histological endometritis, an indicator of pelvic inflammatory disease. METHODS: This study was a secondary data analysis within the T cell Response Against Chlamydia (TRAC) Study, a prospective evaluation of 246 women with or at risk for Chlamydia trachomatis from urban outpatient clinics, who were followed quarterly for 12 months. Risk factors for incident M. genitalium infection were determined by Cox regression. Relative risks were estimated by Poisson regression with robust error measurements for models examining the association between M. genitalium and endometritis (histological evidence of plasma cells in endometrial stroma and neutrophils in the endometrial epithelium) and for models examining risk factors for detection of endometrial M. genitalium infection. RESULTS: M. genitalium prevalence was 16.7%, incidence was 25.3 per 100 person-years and 23% had repeated positive tests. Black race (non-black HRadj 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.9), less education (HRadj 2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.1) and a new sexual partner (HRadj 3.1, 95% CI 1.7 to 5.4) were associated with incident M. genitalium. M. genitalium was associated with endometritis (RRadj 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.7). Trichomonas vaginalis (RRadj 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.4) and endometrial C. trachomatis (RRadj 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8) were associated with endometrial M. genitalium. CONCLUSIONS: M. genitalium is prevalent in women at high risk for C. trachomatis, persists over multiple follow-up visits and is associated with histological endometritis. Studies are needed to determine if screening for M. genitalium will improve reproductive outcomes."
0,Detection of Zika Virus and Human Papilloma Virus in Cervical Cytology Samples using Two Real Time PCR Based Techniques in Ecuadorian Women diagnosed with ASCUS,,"OBJECTIVE: Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance(ASCUS) is the most reported result on pap smears. It is most commonly related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections. However, other pathogens (EBV, Chlamydia) have been reported on cervical samples with abnormal results. Zika virus(ZIKV) has been found to induce cellular abnormalities on different tissues and its presence has been identified on genital secretions. METHODS: Two real-time PCR has been made on cervical samples from the gynecological service of a third level hospital on Guayaquil-Ecuador. This work was part of a bigger study of ZIKV presence on different body fluids. RESULTS: From 89 samples obtained, 19 received an ASCUS result. From these 5 were positive for ZIKV and 5 were positive for HPV, there were no co infections. CONCLUSION: Given the presence of ZIKV RNA and the absence of HPV DNA on cervical samples diagnosed as ASCUS, it might be plausible that ZIKV could be a triggering factor for the induction of cellular changes observed on these cells."
0,Cytological diagnosis of genital ureaplasma urealyticum and its importance in cervical inflammation,10.26355/eurrev_202211_30143,"OBJECTIVE: Cervical smear cytology, which is a gynecological cervical cancer screening test, can provide information about the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or the inflammation they cause. Among them, Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu), which is a subspecies of Mycoplasma was held responsible for high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions and malignancy due to long-lasting complicated vulvovaginitis clinic. We aimed at investigating the role of Uu in the inflammatory process of the cervix and to describe the cytological features that enable it to be recognized microscopically in cervical smear test. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cervical smear and mycoplasma culture data of 123 women with complicated vulvovaginitis findings were evaluated. According to the Uu culture results, women were divided into two groups: the Uu-positive (n=59) and the Uu-negative group (n=64). The groups were compared in terms of cervical smear results, macroscopic view of the cervix, and secondary cytological evaluation results. RESULTS: The presence of inflammatory signs (83.1%) in the Uu-positive group was observed to be 83.1%, whereas 67.2% in the Uu-negative group, and the difference between the two groups was found to be significant (p=0.04). Besides, the difference in aggregated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) between Uu-positive group (59.3%) and Uu-negative group (40.6%) was statistically significant (p=0.04). Similarly, nuclear atypia of epithelial cells in the Uu-positive group (33.9%) was observed to be higher than in the Uu-negative group (17.2%) (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Uu causes inflammation of the cervix and cervical intraepithelial lesions. Aggregated PMNL observed in cervical smear cytology may be one of the findings that will give clues for Uu."
1,Chlamydia screening for pregnant women aged 16-25 years attending an antenatal service: a cost-effectiveness study,10.1111/1471-0528.13567,"OBJECTIVE: Determine the cost-effectiveness of screening all pregnant women aged 16-25 years for chlamydia compared with selective screening or no screening. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness based on a decision model. SETTING: Antenatal clinics in Australia. SAMPLE: Pregnant women, aged 16-25 years. METHODS: Using clinical data from a previous study, and outcomes data from the literature, we modelled the short-term perinatal (12-month time horizon) incremental direct costs and outcomes from a government (as the primary third-party funder) perspective for chlamydia screening. Costs were derived from the Medicare Benefits Schedule, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and average cost-weights reported for hospitalisations classified according to the Australian refined diagnosis-related groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct costs of screening and managing chlamydia complications, number of chlamydia cases detected and treated, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated and subjected to sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Assuming a chlamydia prevalence rate of 3%, screening all antenatal women aged 16-25 years at their first antenatal visit compared with no screening was $34,931 per quality-adjusted life-years gained. Screening all women could result in cost savings when chlamydia prevalence was higher than 11%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were most sensitive to the assumed prevalence of chlamydia, the probability of pelvic inflammatory disease, the utility weight of a positive chlamydia test and the cost of the chlamydia test and doctor's appointment. CONCLUSION: From an Australian government perspective, chlamydia screening of all women aged 16-25 years old during one antenatal visit was likely to be cost-effective compared with no screening or selective screening, especially with increasing chlamydia prevalence. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Chlamydia screening for all pregnant women aged 16-25 years during an antenatal visit is cost effective."
0,Chlamydia Trachomatis Infection in High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Based on Cervical Cytology Specimen,10.31557/APJCP.2019.20.12.3843,"OBJECTIVE: High-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) was associated with the development of cervical cancer. Asymptomatic Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infection is the most common bacterial, sexually-transmitted infection. This study aimed to investigate the association of C. trachomatis in positive HR HPV and the cytological results from liquid-based cytology (LBC). METHODS: 150 residual LBC specimens were collected; all of which had undergone cytology and HPV testing by Cobas. The samples were established as C. trachomatis using real-time PCR (RT-PCR) with Cryptic F/Cryptic R primers. RESULTS: Of 150 positive HPV findings, the most common (72.7%, 109/150) were the 12 other HR HPVs (viz., 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68). The cervical cytology of those positive HR HPVs were mostly negative (70.0%, 105/150).  The C. trachomatis infections in positive HR HPV were 16% (24/150) HPV. The analysis of the abnormal cytology revealed that 41.6% had C. trachomatis co-infection (C. trachomatis and HPV infection) viz., LSIL (20.8%), HSIL (12.5%), and ASC-US (8.3%). A comparison with positive HPV without C. trachomatis co-infection revealed that the highest prevalence was for LSIL, ASC-US, and HSIL (11.1%, 10.3%, and 6.4%, respectively). There was no difference between the abnormalities and negative cervical cytology with negative and positive C. trachomatis co-infection in HR HPV positive (p = 0.174). CONCLUSION: C. trachomatis infection was not significantly associated HR-HPV and abnormal cytology. This study confirms the increasing rate of C. trachomatis infection in asymptomatic women so routine screening for these infections has been suggested to (a) prevent complications such as the chronic pelvic pain associated with prolong infection and (b) reduce sexual transmission of the infection."
0,Are vaginal swabs comparable to cervical smears for human papillomavirus DNA testing?,10.3802/jgo.2018.29.e8,"OBJECTIVE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is widely incorporated into cervical cancer screening strategies. Current screening requires pelvic examination for cervical sampling, which may compromise participation. The acceptance could be raised by introducing testing on vaginal swabs. We explored the interchangeability of vaginal swabs and cervical smears for HPV testing, by means of a prospective study conducted in female sex workers (FSWs). Besides, we report on the occurrence of 32 different HPV genotypes in FSW with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). METHODS: Paired physician-collected vaginal swabs and cervical smears from 303 FSW were tested for HPV using the Abbott RealTime High-Risk HPV assay. Cervical cytology was examined on cervical smears. In case of HSIL/LSIL cytological classification (n=52), both samples were genotyped using INNO-LiPa HPV Genotyping Extra II. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of high-risk (HR)-HPV was 51%. In FSW with HSIL/LSIL cervical cytology, the sensitivity and specificity of vaginal samples for the detection of HR-HPV was 100% and 70% and for probable HR-HPV 100% and 91%. The mean number of genotypes identified in vaginal samples (mean=3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.8-4.2) was significantly higher than in cervical smear samples (mean=2.6; 95% CI=2.1-3.0) (p=0.001). The most frequently encountered HR-HPV genotypes were HPV16, 31, 51, and 52. CONCLUSION: As our study shows that vaginal swabs are equivalent to cervical smears for the detection of (probable) HR-HPV, vaginal swabs can be used for HPV testing in cervical cancer screening strategies. Given the acceptance of vaginal sampling, this finding offers an opportunity to boost screening coverage."
1,A Retrospective Study of Clinical Encounters for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: Missed Opportunities to Screen for Syphilis and HIV?,10.1016/j.jogc.2021.04.007,"OBJECTIVE: Missed screening opportunities may contribute to the rising rates of sexually transmitted and blood borne infections (STBBIs) in Manitoba. This study sought to determine the proportion of women who are screened for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) when admitted with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all inpatient admissions for PID over 3 discrete years (fiscal years 2007, 2012, 2017) at a single tertiary care centre. Data extracted from medical records included STBBI screening performed, clinical signs at presentation, and history of PID or STBBI. To improve the accuracy of our estimates, we complemented the records data with population data from Manitoba. We evaluated predictive factors influencing any or concurrent STBBI screening using bivariate analysis for significance (P < 0.05). RESULTS: One hundred and five admissions met inclusion criteria. Syphilis and HIV screening was ordered concurrently with chlamydia and gonorrhoea screening in 6 (6%) of encounters and was ordered at any point during admission for PID in 28 (27%). A history of substance abuse (odds ratio [OR] 4.94 [95% CI 1.62-15.05] for syphilis screening and OR 6.94 [95% CI 2.38-20.23] for HIV screening) and a positive gonorrhea result while admitted (OR 3.40 [95% CI 1.06-10.88] for syphilis screening) were strongly associated with receiving any screening. Reporting multiple sexual partners was also strongly associated with receiving any STBBI screening while admitted (OR 19.44 [95% CI 2.01-187.92] and OR 15.00 [95% CI 1.58-142.70] for syphilis and HIV screening, respectively). CONCLUSION: A minority of patients were screened for syphilis and HIV while admitted for PID. This study highlights a missed opportunity to screen for STBBI among sexually active women."
0,Increased prevalence of endocervical Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma colonization in infertile women with tubal factor,10.5935/1518-0557.20190078,"OBJECTIVE: Most women suffering from tubal factor infertility do not have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, but rather have asymptomatic upper genital tract infection. Investigating the impacts of such infections, even in the absence of clinically confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease, is critical to understanding the tubal factor of infertility. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the presence of endocervical bacteria is associated with tubal factors in women screened for infertility. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study involved 245 women undergoing hysterosalpingography (HSG), screened for endocervical colonization by Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis, as part of a routine female infertility investigation between 2016 and 2017. RESULTS: endocervical bacterial colonization by Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealiticum, Mycoplasma hominis and other bacteria corresponded to 3.7%, 9.0%; 5.7% and 9.8%, respectively. There was no colonization by Neisseria gonorrhea. The prevalence of tubal factor was significantly higher in patients with positive endocervical bacteria colonization, regardless of bacterial species. When evaluating bacteria species individually, the women who were positive for endocervical Mycoplasma hominis had significantly higher rates of tubal factor. Associations between endocervical bacterial colonization and tubal factor infertility were confirmed by multiple regression analysis adjusted for age and duration of infertility. CONCLUSION: Besides the higher prevalence of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma infectious agents, the findings of this study suggest the possible association of endocervical bacterial colonization - not only Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea, but also Mycoplasma species with tubal performance."
1,Systematic Literature Review and Quantitative Analysis of Health Problems Associated with Sexually Transmitted Neisseria gonorrhoeae Infection,10.1007/s40121-021-00481-z,"OBJECTIVE: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) is the second most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection (STI), leading to serious health problems in men, women and newborns. While early antibiotic treatment is effective, infections are increasingly antibiotic-resistant. No systematic reviews present health problems associated with Ng infections or their likelihood of occurrence. The objective, therefore, was to conduct a systematic literature review to address these gaps. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted of all studies with an English abstract published since 1950 (Pubmed)/1966 (Embase). The search included patients with a history of/current sexually transmitted Ng infection. Expected outcomes were defined from published reviews of gonorrhoea health problems. Observational studies with a control group were included. A decision tree determined the best quality studies for each outcome, prioritising generalisable populations, laboratory-confirmed diagnosis, clearly defined outcomes, no STI co-infections, adjusted analyses and risk estimates. Where feasible, a meta-analysis was performed; otherwise, the best quality study estimates were identified. FINDINGS: In total, 46 studies were included, and 22 health problems were identified. Of these problems, Ng infection was statistically significantly associated with preterm premature ruptures of membranes, preterm birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, infant death, neonatal ophthalmia, schizophrenia in offspring, pelvic inflammatory disease and subsequent tubal infertility, human immunodeficiency virus and prostate cancer/problems. High-quality evidence was generally lacking, with high heterogeneity across studies, and limited or inconclusive data on other health problems. CONCLUSION: Ng infection is associated with severe health problems in women, men and newborns. More high-quality comparative studies are needed to address the limitations in current knowledge."
0,"The Role of Polymorphonuclear Leukocyte Counts from Urethra, Cervix, and Vaginal Wet Mount in Diagnosis of Nongonococcal Lower Genital Tract Infection",10.1155/2018/8236575,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) inflammatory response in women with nongonococcal lower genital tract infection (LGTI) can be used to optimize criteria for syndromic treatment. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 375 women attending the STI clinic in Oslo. Urethral, cervical, and vaginal specimens underwent microscopy for PMNLs. Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) and other STIs were detected in the cervical/vaginal swabs and urine, using nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). After excluding vulvovaginal candidiasis, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis, we correlated clinical and microscopic signs of inflammation with positive NAAT for Ct, mycoplasma genitalium (Mg), and Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu) in a subgroup of 293 women. RESULTS: To predict a positive Ct, the combination of high cut-off urethritis (≥10 PMNLs/HPF) and microscopic cervicitis had a high specificity of 0.93, a PPV of 0.37, and a sensitivity of 0.35. LGTI criteria had low predicting values for Mg and Uu. CONCLUSION: Including microscopic criteria for the diagnosis of LGTI gives better indication for presumptive antibiotic treatment than anamnestic and clinical diagnosis alone."
0,Performance of a rapid molecular test to detect Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in women with pelvic inflammatory disease,10.1016/j.eimce.2021.03.008,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of a rapid molecular test for the diagnosis and clinical management of PID. METHODS: This observational study included 75 patients with mild-to-moderate PID (n=33), severe PID (n=29) and non-specific lower abdominal pain (NSAP) (n=13). CT/NG infections were analyzed using a standard and a rapid test. A cost analysis was carried out. RESULTS: Samples of 19 patients (25.3%) were CT/NG positive. Concordance between rapid and standard tests was 100%. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of CT/NG in mild-to-moderate compared to severe PID. Costs differed according only to disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid molecular tests could help with the diagnosis of PID in sexually active women in clinical settings in which a standard technique is not available."
0,The safety of intrauterine contraception initiation among women with current asymptomatic cervical infections or at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections,10.1016/j.contraception.2016.05.013,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) among women with current asymptomatic undiagnosed cervical infection or who are at high risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), comparing those who have a copper-bearing (Cu-) or levonorgestrel (LNG-) intrauterine device (IUD) placed with women who do not. STUDY DESIGN: We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library for articles from January 1984 through January 2016 addressing our objective. We assessed study quality using the United States Preventive Services Task Force evidence grading system. RESULTS: Our search strategy yielded 2220 articles, of which 10 met inclusion criteria. Two studies provided direct evidence of PID rates in women with undiagnosed gonococcal or chlamydial (GC/CT) infection or at high risk for STIs initiating IUDs versus other contraceptive methods (level II-2, fair to poor), and neither study found a difference. Eight studies provided indirect evidence (II-2 to II-3, fair to poor). One study found no difference in PID rates between initiators of Cu- versus LNG-IUDs. Five studies compared algorithms based on patient factors with laboratory GC/CT screening to predict cervical infection. Based on likelihood ratios, none of these algorithms adequately identified women at high risk of asymptomatic cervical infection who should not undergo IUD placement. Two studies compared IUD placement on the same day as STI screening with delayed placement after screening and found no difference in PID rates. CONCLUSION: Limited evidence suggests that IUD placement does not increase the risk of PID compared with no IUD placement among women with asymptomatic undiagnosed cervical infection or at high risk of STIs. Algorithms based on patient characteristics to identify women with asymptomatic GC/CT may be overly restrictive, leading to missed opportunities for IUD initiation. Historical concerns about higher PID risk among women at risk for STIs who use IUDs may not be relevant with modern devices and STI screening and treatment practices."
0,Predictive values of cervix length measurement based on transvaginal ultrasonography combined with pathological examination of placenta for premature  delivery and correlation between premature delivery and infection.,10.26355/eurrev_202311_34297,"OBJECTIVE: The predictive values of cervix length (CL) measurement based on transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and pathological examination of placenta for  premature delivery (PTD) were investigated, and the correlation between PTD and  infection was analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 120 pregnant women with  PTD or high-risk factors for PTD admitted to Hengyang Maternal and Child Health  Hospital, between February 2020 and March 2022 were included in this  retrospective study. There were 36 subjects in the PTD group and 84 in the normal  delivery group (control group). They underwent pathological examination of the  placenta and TVUS for CL measurement. The final gestational age was set as the  standard for the evaluation of the predictive values of pathological examination  of the placenta and TVUS. Moreover, a pathological examination of the placenta  was used to analyze the correlation between PTD and infection. RESULTS: The  sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative  predictive value (NPV) of joint inspection were remarkably superior to those of  single CL or pathological examination of the placenta (p<0.05). The proportion of  pregnant women with CL ≤30 mm and positive placental pathology was higher than  that of pregnant women with CL >30 mm and negative placental pathology (p<0.05).  In addition, the incidence of Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), Chlamydia trachomatis  (CT), and chorioamnionitis (CA) in the vaginal discharge of the PTD group was  markedly superior to that of the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The  combination of CL ≤30 mm and positive placental pathology could effectively  predict PTD, and placental infection was notably correlated with the occurrence  of PTD."
0,No. 385-Indications for Pelvic Examination,10.1016/j.jogc.2018.12.007,"OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this document is to clarify the indications for pelvic examination. INTENDED USERS: Physicians, including gynaecologists, obstetricians, family physicians, and emergency physicians; nurses, including registered nurses and nurse practitioners; midwives, including midwives in clinical practice and midwifery trainees; medical trainees, including medical students, residents, and fellows; and all other health care providers who care for women. TARGET POPULATION: This publication provides evidence and expert-based recommendations for pelvic examination in adult women (18 years and older) both with and without gynaecologic symptoms. OUTCOMES: This publication clarifies indications for pelvic examination in the context of recently published national task force statements on the utility of pelvic examination. We aim to ensure that women who have clinical indications for examination receive proper clinical investigation with minimal delays to diagnosis of treatable disease. EVIDENCE: For this committee opinion, relevant studies were identified in PubMed and Medline using the following terms, either alone or in combination, with the search limited to English-language materials and human subjects and no publication date cut-off: pelvic examination, bimanual examination, speculum examination, rectovaginal examination, ovarian cancer screening, asymptomatic women, periodic health examination. The search was performed in May and June 2018. Relevant evidence was selected for inclusion in the following order: meta-analyses, systematic reviews, guidelines and national task force statements, randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, observational studies, non-systematic reviews, case series, and reports. Additional articles were identified by cross-referencing the identified publications. A formal systematic review was not conducted for all topics discussed due to the paucity of evidence and number of different subtopics discussed. The total number of publications included in this review was 66. VALIDATION METHODS: The content and recommendations were drafted and agreed upon by the principal authors. The Boards of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology of Canada (GOC), the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC), and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) approved the final draft for publication after review by their respective representative committees. The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology framework (Tables 1 and 2). The Summary of Findings is available upon request. BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: This committee opinion should benefit all women with and without gynaecologic symptoms who present to gynaecologists and primary care practitioners. It will help guide practitioners in identifying indications for pelvic examination to reduce unnecessary examination with related potential harm while also increasing indicated examination to reduce delays in diagnosis of treatable gynaecologic conditions. GUIDELINE UPDATE: This SOGC Committee Opinion will be automatically reviewed 5 years after publication to determine if all or part of the committee opinion should be updated. However, this review may be performed earlier if new high-impact research is published in the interim. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: 1. National and international statements and guidelines on pelvic examination should not be interpreted to suggest that the pelvic examination is irrelevant or noncontributory to physical assessment or that the pelvic examination in symptomatic women should be omitted. 2. Pelvic examination may include visual inspection, speculum examination, bimanual examination, single digit examination, and/or rectovaginal examination depending on the indication for examination. 3. No study published to date has adequately evaluated any component of the pelvic examination as a screening method for any type of malignant gynaecologic disease, except for the speculum examination for cervical cancer cytology screening. As such, any universal recommendations for or against pelvic examinations for other indications can only be made based on expert opinion and low-quality evidence. 4. In asymptomatic women at average risk for cervical cancer, cervical cytology screening reduces both the incidence of, and mortality from, cervical cancer by detecting pre-invasive, treatable lesions. 5. In asymptomatic women at average risk of malignancy, a visual and bimanual examination at the time of obtaining cervical cytology samples may add value to this screening manoeuvre: Women might not raise certain gynaecologic concerns until the time of pelvic examination; the examination provides an opportunity for patient education and practitioner skill maintenance; and, although inadequately studied to date, there may be positive effects on ovarian and vulvar malignancy that require further investigation. These potential benefits should be weighed against potential harms like patient discomfort and false positives/negatives that may result in inappropriate reassurance or unnecessary investigations/interventions. RECOMMENDATIONS: Symptomatic Women. 1) Any woman with gynaecologic complaints including, but not limited to, vulvar complaints, vaginal discharge, abnormal premenopausal bleeding, postmenopausal bleeding, infertility, pelvic organ prolapse symptoms, urinary incontinence, new and unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, increased abdominal size/bloating, and difficulty eating/early satiety), pelvic pain, or dyspareunia should undergo appropriate components of the pelvic examination to identify benign or malignant disease (strong, low). 2) Health care providers may consider discussing the risks and benefits of performing a baseline pelvic examination including visual and bimanual examination prior to prescribing hormonal replacement therapy/menopausal hormonal treatment (weak, very low). Asymptomatic Women. 3) Health care practitioners should perform cervical cytology cancer screening in accordance with provincial/territorial guidelines (strong, strong). 4) There is insufficient evidence to guide recommendations on screening pelvic examination for noncervical gynaecologic malignancy or any benign gynaecologic disease in healthy, asymptomatic women with average risk of malignancy. However, health care practitioners may consider performing a screening pelvic examination including visual, speculum, and bimanual examinations in concert with cervical cytology sampling intervals as recommended by provincial/territorial guidelines. This practice may identify clinically important benign or malignant disease not recognized or reported by the patient (weak, very low). 5) In women over age 70 who no longer require screening with cervical cytology, health care practitioners should consider continuing periodic screening of asymptomatic women for vulvar disease with inspection of the vulva, perineum, and anus to identify benign or malignant disease unrecognized by this population. There is insufficient evidence to guide recommendations on frequency of this examination (weak, low). 6) Women with a personal history of gynaecologic malignancy, a genetic diagnosis that increases gynaecologic malignancy risk, or a history of in utero diethylstilbestrol exposure may benefit from more frequent screening pelvic examinations to identify early primary, recurrent, or metastatic malignancy in the absence of symptoms. Because there is inadequate evidence to define these screening intervals, they should be in accordance with provincial/territorial guidelines and expert opinion (weak, very low). 7. Non-invasive and self-collection screening options for chlamydia and gonorrhea are acceptable in asymptomatic women, but pelvic examination, including visual inspection, speculum examination, and bimanual examination, is required in the presence of symptoms to rule out pelvic inflammatory disease or tubo-ovarian abscess (strong, low). 8) No pelvic examination is required prior to prescription of hormonal contraception in a healthy woman with no gynaecologic symptoms (strong, low)."
0,Does cervical ureaplasma/mycoplasma colonization increase the lower uterine segment bleeding risk during cesarean section among patients with placenta previa? A cross-sectional study,,"OBJECTIVE: The underlying inflammation of endometrium may impede normal implantation of placenta during pregnancy. Our objective is to show cervical colonization of ureaplasma and/or mycoplasma as a marker of endometritis in pregnancies complicated with placenta previa that can be a risk factor for placenta accreta and peripartum hemorrhage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cervical cultures for ureaplasma urealyticum and mycoplasma genitalium have been taken from the endocervical region of the cervix of the patients. Subsequent uterine lower segment bleeding suggesting placenta implantation defects have been evaluated during cesarean section. RESULTS: Of 25 patients: ten (40%) had negative cervical cultures for cervical mycoplasma and/or ureaplasma, 9 (36%) were found to be culture positive for cervical ureaplasma, 1 (4%) was found to be culture positive for cervical mycoplasma. Half of the 10 patients with positive cervical cultures for ureaplasma or mycoplasma and 6 of (40%) 15 patients with negative results had experienced lower uterine segment bleeding during cesarean section. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial colonization of cervix in particular with ureaplasma and/or mycoplasma is found to be strongly associated with placenta previa. Before a planned pregnancy, treatment of this infection with appropriate antibiotics is necessary to prevent underlying uterine endometritis that increases the risk for abnormal implantation of placenta."
1,"Rates of pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy in Australia, 2009-2014: ecological analysis of hospital data",10.1136/sextrans-2017-053423,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse yearly rates of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and ectopic pregnancy (EP) diagnosed in hospital settings in Australia from 2009 to 2014. METHODS: We calculated yearly PID and EP diagnosis rates in three states (Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland) for women aged 15-44 years using hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) attendance data, with population and live birth denominators. We stratified PID diagnoses as chlamydial-related or gonorrhoeal-related (Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)-related or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG)-related), acute, unspecified and chronic, and analysed variations by year, age and residential area using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: For PID, the rate of all admissions in 2014 was 63.3 per 100 000 women (95% CI 60.8 to 65.9) and of all presentations in EDs was 97.0 per 100 000 women (95% CI 93.9 to 100.2). Comparing 2014 with 2009, the rate of all PID admissions did not change, but the rate of all presentations in EDs increased (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 1.34, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.45), and for admissions by PID category was higher for CT-related or NG-related PID (aIRR 1.73, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.28) and unspecified PID (aIRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19), and lower for chronic PID (aIRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.95). For EP, in 2014 the rate of all admissions was 17.4 (95% CI 16.9 to 17.9) per 1000 live births and of all ED presentations was 15.6 (95% CI 15.1 to 16.1). Comparing 2014 with 2009, the rates of all EP admissions (aIRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.08) and rates in EDs (aIRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.31) were higher. CONCLUSIONS: PID and EP remain important causes of hospital admissions for female STI-associated complications. Hospital EDs care for more PID cases than inpatient departments, particularly for young women. Updated primary care data are needed to better understand PID epidemiology and healthcare usage."
0,Concordance of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in infertile couples: impact on semen parameters,10.1016/j.urology.2013.02.044,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between mycoplasma infection and human infertility, we determined the concordance of Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) and Mycoplasma hominis (MH) detection in infertile and fertile couples, and assessed semen parameters in both groups. METHODS: Fifty infertile couples without a female factor attending a fertility clinic and 48 fertile couples were randomly screened for UU and MH. The concordance between partners was compared between the fertile and infertile groups. Semen and endocervical specimens were evaluated using the commercially available Mycofast Evolution2 test. RESULTS: UU was detected in 24 semen specimens (48%) from the infertile men, in 12 specimens from fertile men (25%), in 20 endocervical specimens from infertile women (40%), and 11 from fertile women (22.9%). UU was detected higher in infertile men than in fertile men (P = .022). The concordance of UU was higher in infertile couples (32%) than in fertile couples (12.5%, P = .022). The concordance of MH between male and female partners in the 2 groups did not differ significantly. The mean values of total motility, progressive motility, normal morphology, vitality, and total motile sperm count were significantly lower in sperm from infertile men than from fertile men. Progressive motility and vitality were significantly lower in UU-positive men than in men without UU, and low total motility and total motile sperm count were significantly related to the presence of MH. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider the roles of UU and MH in infertility and routinely screen infertile couples for the presence of these mycoplasma species."
0,[Evaluation of two methodologies for Chlamydia trachomatis detection in cervical samples of two clinics],10.3760/cma.j.issn.0376-2491.2017.17.012,"Objective: To compare the positive rates of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in gynecological clinic and reproductive medicine clinic by detecting cervical samples from two clinics with three assays of different methodologies. To determine the performances of enzyme assay and immunochromatography (ICA) assay compared to the real-time PCR assay. Methods: Seven hundred and eleven samples of gynecological clinic from May 2014 to May 2015 and 711 samples of reproductive medicine clinic from June 2014 to April 2015 were collected in Henan Province People's Hospital. Three cervical swabs were collected from each participant. The three samples were eluted with saline water then mixed. The samples were detected with three methodologies respectively after dividing the mixture into three. Results: The positive rates of CT in gynecological clinic and reproductive medicine clinic were 9.98% (71/711) and 4.22% (30/711) by real-time PCR assay, 10.83% (77/711) and 5.06% (36/711) by enzyme assay, 4.78% (34/711) and 2.11% (15/711) by ICA assay. The sensitivity and specificity were 85.1% (86/101) and 98.0% (1 294/1 321) by enzyme assay. The sensitivity of ICA assay was 45.5% (46/101) and specificity was 99.8% (1 318/1 321) compared to the real-time PCR assay. Conclusion: The positive rate of CT in gynecological clinic was markedly higher than that in reproductive medicine clinic (P<0.05). The ICA assay, while exhibiting a high specificity, had unacceptably low sensitivity compared to real-time PCR assay. The enzyme assay had higher sensitivity but slightly worse specificity."
0,Epidemiology of cervical cancer in Colombia,10.21149/spm.v56i5.7368,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence, mortality, time trends and prognostic factors for cervical cancer in Cali, Colombia, and to review the molecular epidemiological evidence showing that HPV is the major and necessary cause of cervical cancer and the implications of this discovery for primary and secondary prevention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Incidence rates of cervical cancer during a 45-year period (1962-2007) were estimated based on the population-based cancer registry of Cali and the mortality statistics from the Municipal Health Secretariat of Cali. Prognostic factors were estimated based on relative survival. Review of the molecular epidemiological evidence linking HPV to cervical cancer was focused on the studies carried out in Cali and in other countries. RESULTS: Incidence rates of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) declined from 120.4 per 100 000 in 1962-1966 to 25.7 in 2003-2007 while those of adenocarcinoma increased from 4.2 to 5.8. Mortality rates for cervical cancer declined from 18.5 in 1984-1988 to 7.0 per 100 000 in 2009-2011. Survival was lower in women over 65 years of age and in clinical stages 3-4. Review of the molecular epidemiological evidence showed that certain types of HPV are the central and necessary cause of cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: A decline in the incidence and mortality of SCC and an increase in the incidence of adenocarcinoma during a 45-year period was documented in Cali, Colombia."
0,Distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes and bacterial vaginosis presence in cervical samples from Paraguayan indigenous,10.1016/j.ijid.2015.08.007,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of human papillomavirus (HPV) types and to assess bacterial vaginosis (BV) possible associations with cervical infections in indigenous Paraguayan women of the Department of Presidente Hayes. METHODS: This study included 181 sexually active women without cervical lesions. HPV typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction with primers PGMY 09/11 followed by reverse line hybridization. BV was diagnosed by the Nugent criteria using the results from a Gram stain smear. RESULTS: Sixteen percent of women were positive for at least one high risk HPV type (HR-HPV). The most frequent genotypes were HPV 16 (4.4%), followed by HPV 58 (3.3%), HPV 45 (3.3%), HPV 53 (2.8%) and HPV 11 (2.8%). A significant association between HR-HPV and BV was observed (p=0.01). In addition, women with BV had a higher frequency of Chlamydia trachomatis (p=0.0007), Trichomonas vaginalis (p=0.00009), Mycoplasma hominis (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A large variety of HPV genotypes was detected and showed a slightly different pattern from previous studies on urban women in Paraguay, with the predominance of HR-HPV. Furthermore, the information of co-infections involved in BV could be useful for the improvement of national prevention programs, as well as for laboratory surveillance of these genital infections."
0,Occurrence of Mycoplasma genitalium in the peritoneal fluid of fertile and infertile women with detailed analysis among infertile women,10.1016/j.micpath.2019.02.006,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of occurrence of Mycoplasma genitalium infection in the peritoneal fluid of infertile women as compared to fertile women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have selected 162 infertile women aged 22-40 years as study subject and 162 women posted for elective caesarean section, were taken as control. Peritoneal fluid of the infertile women and control samples was obtained by suction during diagnostic laparoscopy and M. genitalium infection was diagnosed by PCR method. RESULTS: The genetic material of M. genitalium was detected in the peritoneal fluid of 10 subjects in the infertile group and in 1 from the control group. High prevalence was found in cases with unexplained (13.3%) and primary infertility (6.7%) in comparison to explained (4.5) and secondary infertility (4.5%). Consistent relationship was reported between past obstetric history and presence of M. genitalium infection in infertile subjects. M. genitalium infection was two times more common in women with cervicitis (8.6%) and with blocked fallopian tubes (8.4%). Out of the 101 cases with normal looking uterus, 7 had M. genitalium infection, while 3 out of 61 cases with a congested uterus had infection. The fallopian tubes appeared normal in about 53% cases whereas, inflammation, hydrosalpinx, peritubular adhesions and endometriotic patches were noted in 11.7%, 4.3%, 19.7% and 11.1% of cases respectively. CONCLUSION: Present study shows association between M. genitalium infection and infertility. We suggest routine screening and early treatment of this pathogen because prolonged inflammation of upper genital tract sites may lead to significant reproductive morbidity and infertility."
0,"The value of chlamydial antibody level for predicting tubal blockage among women undergoing hysterosalpingography in Lagos, Nigeria",10.1016/j.ijgo.2015.12.009,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis infection among Nigerian women undergoing hysterosalpingography (HSG) and to identify any correlation between chlamydial antibody levels and a diagnosis of tubal disease. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1 to June 30, 2013, among women scheduled to undergo HSG in the radiology department of Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Endocervical swabs and serum samples were collected to assess the levels of chlamydial antigen and antibody, respectively. RESULTS: Among 150 participants, 83 (55.3%) had bilateral tubal patency and 67 (44.7%) had tubal disease. Overall, 53 (35.3%) women had positive test results for chlamydial antibodies; however, none of the participants tested positive for chlamydial antigen. Women with tubal disease were more likely to test positive for chlamydial antibodies (n=44 [65.7%]) than were those whose test results were negative (n=9 [10.8%]; P<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of chlamydial antibody testing to predict tubal disease diagnosed by HSG were 66% and 89%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The presence of chlamydial antibodies was quantitatively related to the likelihood of HSG-diagnosed tubal disease."
0,"[Prevalence of infections (Chlamydia, Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma) in patients with altered tuboperitoneal factor]",,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of Chlamydia, Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma in patients with peritoneal tubal factor infertility and altered. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive, observational, retrospec- tive, transversal, infertility patients Juarez Hospital of Mexico 2013 to 2015. Study included patients with infertility diagnosis and detection of antibodies (IgG) by ELISA for Chlamydia and vaginal cultures for Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma, hysterosalpingography and histerolapa- roscopia with chromotubation RESULTS: 46 patients with a mean age of 32.5 years. It was found that 36% were positive for these infections (n = 17): Chlamydia in 8.7% (n = 4), Ureaplasma in 21.7% (n = 10) and Mycoplasma in 6.5% (n = 3). Chlamydia patients and bilateral tubal occlusion (OTB) in 5.8% (n = 1), Ureaplasma and OTB (n = 5) were identified in 29.4% of them with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and tubal obstruction Ureaplasma right (OTD) in 5.8% (n = 1), Ureaplasma and tubal patency but with loose adhesions in 5.8% (n = 1) and Mycoplasma with OTB in 11.1% (n = 2), p = 0.425. Hysterosalpingography showed a sensitivity of 59% and specificity of 79%. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no association of variables, Ureaplasma infection was more common in patients with infertility and tubal damage."
0,[Interest of emergency endocervical specimens],10.1016/j.gyobfe.2014.05.015,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the diagnosis profitability of endocervical specimen (ES) within the framework of a teaching gynecological emergency department by studying the circumstances of realization and its bacteriological results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included in our study all the patients who had a gynecological exam with an ES during a consultation in our gynecological teaching emergency department of Tours between January 1st, 2012 and December 31st, 2012. We estimated the diagnosis profitability of realization of the ES (positivity rate within the population with ES, diagnosis correction in case of pelvic inflammatory disease). RESULTS: Over the study period, 614 (12.4%) women consulting in our emergency department had an ES, which was positive among 102 (16.6%) of them, and a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease in 64 patients. ES had a higher pertinence in case of abdominal pain and a lesser one in case of pregnancy for whom ES realisation must be limited. The diagnosis correction due to ES was observed in 46.8% of pelvic inflammatory disease. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic profitability of the endocervical specimen in our emergency department was low, taking into account the whole cohort, but ES permitted to correct the diagnosis in about half of diagnosed pelvic inflammatory diseases. The endocervical specimens seem to have no profit in pregnant women."
0,Home Self-Collection by Mail to Test for Human Papillomavirus and Sexually Transmitted Infections,10.1097/AOG.0000000000002964,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity and acceptability of at-home self-collection to test for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) and sexually transmitted infections among women overdue for cervical cancer screening by national guidelines. METHODS: Low-income, infrequently screened women were recruited from the general population in North Carolina to participate in an observational study. Participants provided two self-collected cervicovaginal samples (one at home and one in the clinic) and a clinician-collected cervical sample. Samples were tested for high-risk HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Mycoplasma genitalium. Cervical samples were also tested by liquid-based cytology. RESULTS: Overall, 193 women had conclusive high-risk HPV results for all three samples and cytology results. Prevalence of high-risk HPV within self-home samples (12.4%) was not different from that within clinician samples (11.4%; P=.79) and from that within self clinic samples (15.5%; P=.21). Positivity for high-risk HPV in all sample types increased with increasing grades of cervical abnormality (P<.001). Self-home samples detected high-risk HPV in all identified cases of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse. Detection was comparable across sample types for T vaginalis (range 10.2-10.8%), M genitalium (3.3-5.5%), C trachomatis (1.1-2.1%), and N gonorrhoeae (0-0.5%). Kappa values between sample types ranged from 0.56 to 0.66 for high-risk HPV, 0.86-0.91 for T vaginalis, and 0.65-0.83 for M genitalium. Most participants reported no difficulty understanding self-collection instructions (93.6%) and were willing to use self-collection in the future (96.3%). CONCLUSION: Mail-based, at-home self-collection for high-risk HPV and sexually transmitted infection detection was valid and well accepted among infrequently screened women in our study. These findings support the future use of high-risk HPV self-collection to increase cervical cancer screening rates among higher risk women in the United States."
1,Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy in women with planned pregnancy: a case-control study,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2014.07.049,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors for ectopic pregnancy (EP) in women with planned pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This case-control study was conducted in women with planned pregnancy and included 900 women diagnosed with EP (case group) and 889 women with intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) as the control group matched in terms of age and gestational week. Socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive history, gynecological and surgical history, previous contraceptive use, and history of infertility were compared between the two groups. Blood samples were collected from all the participants to detect serum chlamydia trachomatis (CT) IgG antibody. The odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidential interval (CI) of each variable was calculated by univariable conditional logistic regression analysis. Factors significantly different between both groups, as revealed by univariable analysis, were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model by stepwise selection. RESULTS: The risk of EP was associated with previous adnexal surgery (adjusted OR=3.99, 95% CI: 2.40-6.63), uncertainty of previous pelvic inflammatory disease (adjusted OR=6.89, 95% CI: 3.29-14.41), and positive CT IgG serology (adjusted OR=5.26, 95% CI: 3.94-7.04). A history of infertility including tubal infertility (adjusted OR=3.62, 95% CI: 1.52-8.63), non-tubal infertility (adjusted OR=3.34, 95% CI: 1.60-6.93), and in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment (adjusted OR=5.96, 95% CI: 1.68-21.21) were correlated with the risk of EP. Women who had previously used condoms were less likely to have EP during the current cycle (adjusted OR=0.27, 95% CI: 0.21-0.36). CONCLUSIONS: Besides well-acknowledged risk factors for EP, attention should be paid to women with planned pregnancy who have a history of infertility and/or IVF treatment, to prevent complications from EP."
0,Azithromycin-based Extended-Spectrum Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Cesarean: Role of Placental Colonization with Genital Ureaplasmas and Mycoplasmas,10.1055/s-0038-1675766,"OBJECTIVE: To explore whether the effect of azithromycin (AZI) on postcesarean infections varied by the presence/absence of genital mycoplasmataceae placental colonization. STUDY DESIGN: This was a single-center substudy of multicenter double-blind C/SOAP (Cesarean Section Optimal Antibiotic Prophylaxis) trial of women randomized to AZI or placebo (+cefazolin) antibiotic prophylaxis at cesarean. Chorioamnion/placenta specimens were tested for genital mycoplasmataceae colonization by polymerase chain reaction. Primary outcome was a composite of endometritis, wound infection, or other infections up to 6 weeks postpartum. Analysis was intent-to-treat; logistic regression was used to evaluate interactions between treatment assignment (AZI/placebo) and the presence/absence of mycoplasmataceae and to quantify effects of AZI in analyses stratified by the presence/absence of these microorganisms. RESULTS: Specimens from 613 women (303 AZI and 310 placebo) were evaluated. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, and approximately 1/3 (30.3%) had mycoplasmataceae placental/chorioamnion colonization. There was no evidence of effect modification (p interaction = 0.79) between treatment assignment and the presence/absence of organisms. Stratified analyses showed fewer events in the AZI group in the presence (odds ratio [OR]: 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-1.01) and absence (OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.24-1) of mycoplasmataceae. Results were similar with endometritis/wound infections and with ureaplasmas/mycoplasmas considered separately. CONCLUSION: The reduction in postcesarean infection with AZI does not vary based on the presence or absence of genital mycoplasmataceae placental colonization."
1,Which sexually active young female students are most at risk of pelvic inflammatory disease? A prospective study,10.1136/sextrans-2015-052063,"OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in female students. METHODS: We performed a prospective study set in 11 universities and 9 further education colleges in London. In 2004-2006, 2529 sexually experienced, multiethnic, female students, mean age 20.8 years, provided self-taken vaginal samples and completed questionnaires at recruitment to the Prevention of Pelvic Infection chlamydia screening trial. After 12 months, they were followed up by questionnaire backed by medical record search and assessed for PID by blinded genitourinary medicine physicians. RESULTS: Of 2004 (79%) participants who reported numbers of sexual partners during follow-up, 32 (1.6%, 95% CI 1.1% to 2.2%) were diagnosed with PID. The strongest predictor of PID was baseline Chlamydia trachomatis (relative risk (RR) 5.7, 95% CI 2.6 to 15.6). After adjustment for baseline C. trachomatis, significant predictors of PID were ≥2 sexual partners or a new sexual partner during follow-up (RR 4.0, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.5; RR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.3), age <20 years (RR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 7.0), recruitment from a further education college rather than a university (RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.3) and history at baseline of vaginal discharge (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.8) or pelvic pain (RR 4.1, 95% CI 2.0 to 8.3) in the previous six months. Bacterial vaginosis and Mycoplasma genitalium infection were no longer significantly associated with PID after adjustment for baseline C. trachomatis. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple or new partners in the last 12 months, age <20 years and attending a further education college rather than a university were risk factors for PID after adjustment for baseline C. trachomatis infection. Sexual health education and screening programmes could be targeted at these high-risk groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00115388)."
0,"The association between sexually transmitted infections, human papillomavirus, and cervical cytology abnormalities among women in Greece",10.1016/j.ijid.2018.06.001,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the presence of cytological changes in the cervix in a cohort of sexually active women in Greece. METHODS: Cervical cytology testing and the molecular typing of HPV and other STIs were performed for 345 sexually active women aged between 18 and 45 years (mean 33.2±7.2years) visiting a gynaecology clinic for routine cervical screening. The association of HPV and STI detection with cytological findings was investigated. RESULTS: HPV was detected in 61 women (17.7%) and STIs in 82 (23.8%). Ureaplasma spp was the most frequently detected pathogen, which was found in 63 (18.2%) women, followed by Mycoplasma spp (21 women, 25.6%) and Chlamydia trachomatis (five women, 6.1%). HPV positivity only (with no co-presence of STI) was associated with an abnormal cytology (odds ratio 6.9, p<0.001), while women who were negative for both HPV and STIs had a higher probability of a normal cytology (odds ratio 0.36, p<0.01). Sixteen out of the 63 (25.4%) women who tested positive for Ureaplasma spp, harboured a high-risk HPV type (odds ratio 2.3, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In a population with a high prevalence of Ureaplasma spp, there was an association of this pathogen with high-risk HPV infection, a finding that needs further elucidation."
0,Canadian Contraception Consensus (Part 3 of 4): Chapter 7--Intrauterine Contraception,10.1016/j.jogc.2015.12.002,"OBJECTIVE: To provide guidelines for health care providers on the use of contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy and on the promotion of healthy sexuality. OUTCOMES: Overall efficacy of cited contraceptive methods, assessing reduction in pregnancy rate, safety, ease of use, and side effects; the effect of cited contraceptive methods on sexual health and general well-being; and the relative cost and availability of cited contraceptive methods in Canada. EVIDENCE: Published literature was retrieved through searches of Medline and The Cochrane Database from January 1994 to January 2015 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., contraception, sexuality, sexual health) and key words (e.g., contraception, family planning, hormonal contraception, emergency contraception). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English from January 1994 to January 2015. Searches were updated on a regular basis in incorporated in the guideline to June 2015. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. VALUES: The quality of the evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1). CHAPTER 7: INTRAUTERINE CONTRACEPTION: SUMMARY STATEMENTS: 1. Intrauterine contraceptives are as effective as permanent contraception methods. (II-2) 2. The use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) 52 mg by patients taking tamoxifen is not associated with recurrence of breast cancer. (I) 3. Intrauterine contraceptives have a number of noncontraceptive benefits. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) 52 mg significantly decreases menstrual blood loss (I) and dysmenorrhea. (II-2) Both the copper intrauterine device and the LNG-IUS significantly decrease the risk of endometrial cancer. (II-2) 4. The risk of uterine perforation decreases with inserter experience but is higher in postpartum and breastfeeding women. (II-2) 5. The risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is increased slightly in the first month after intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) insertion, but the absolute risk is low. Exposure to sexually transmitted infections and not the IUC itself is responsible for PID occurring after the first month of use. (II-2) 6. Nulliparity is not associated with an increased risk of intrauterine contraceptive expulsion. (II-2) 7. Ectopic pregnancy with an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) is rare, but when a pregnancy occurs with an IUC in situ, it is an ectopic pregnancy in 15% to 50% of the cases. (II-2) 8. In women who conceive with an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) in place, early IUC removal improves outcomes but does not entirely eliminate risks. (II-2) 9. Intrauterine contraceptives do not increase the risk of infertility. (II-2) 10. Immediate insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive (10 minutes postplacental to 48 hours) postpartum or post-Caesarean section is associated with a higher continuation rate compared with insertion at 6 weeks postpartum. (I) 11. Immediate insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC; 10 minutes postplacental to 48 hours) postpartum or post-Caesarean section is associated with a higher risk of expulsion. (I) The benefit of inserting an IUC immediately postpartum or post-Caesarean section outweighs the disadvantages of increased risk of perforation and expulsion. (II-C) 12. Insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive in breastfeeding women is associated with a higher risk of uterine perforation in the first postpartum year. (II-2) 13. Immediate insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) post-abortion significantly reduces the risk of repeat abortion (II-2) and increases IUC continuation rates at 6 months. (I) 14. Antibiotic prophylaxis for intrauterine contraceptive insertion does not significantly reduce postinsertion pelvic infection. (I) RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Health care professionals should be careful not to restrict access to intrauterine contraceptives (IUC) owing to theoretical or unproven risks. (III-A) Health care professionals should offer IUCs as a first-line method of contraception to both nulliparous and multiparous women. (II-2A) 2. In women seeking intrauterine contraception (IUC) and presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding and/or dysmenorrhea, health care professionals should consider the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system 52 mg over other IUCs. (I-A) 3. Patients with breast cancer taking tamoxifen may consider a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system 52 mg after consultation with their oncologist. (I-A) 4. Women requesting a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or a copper-intrauterine device should be counseled regarding changes in bleeding patterns, sexually transmitted infection risk, and duration of use. (III-A) 5. A health care professional should be reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant prior to inserting an intrauterine contraceptive at any time during the menstrual cycle. (III-A) 6. Health care providers should consider inserting an intrauterine contraceptive immediately after an induced abortion rather than waiting for an interval insertion. (I-B) 7. In women who conceive with an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) in place, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy should be excluded as arly as possible. (II-2A) Once an ectopic pregnancy has been excluded, the IUC should be removed without an invasive procedure. The IUC may be removed at the time of a surgical termination. (II-2B) 8. In the case of pelvic inflammatory disease, it is not necessary to remove the intrauterine contraceptive unless there is no clinical improvement after 48 to 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment. (II-2B) 9. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis for intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) insertion is not indicated. (I-B) Health care providers should perform sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing in women at high risk of STI at the time of IUC insertion. If the test is positive for chlamydia and/or gonorrhea, the woman should be appropriately treated postinsertion and the IUC can remain in situ. (II-2B) 10. Unscheduled bleeding in intrauterine contraception users, when persistent or associated with pelvic pain, should be investigated to rule out infection, pregnancy, gynecological pathology, expulsion or malposition.

1,Chlamydia trachomatis Infection: Screening and Management,,"OBJECTIVE: To review current criteria and rationale for Chlamydia trachomatis screening, testing methods, and treatment of infection. METHODS: Review of the literature. RESULTS: C. trachomatis urogenital infections are an important public health problem. Screening for C. trachomatis in women age 25 and younger and men and women of any age at increased risk allows for the early treatment of disease, avoiding morbidity such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain, and reducing health care costs. CONCLUSION: Current screening recommendations are not being implemented satisfactorily. Home-based methods of screening are acceptable and may improve universal screening rates."
0,Common Bacterial and Viral Infections: Review of Management in the Pregnant Patient,10.1177/1060028018817935,"OBJECTIVE: To review the treatment of common bacterial and viral infections occurring in the pregnant patient. DATA SOURCES: A literature search of MEDLINE was performed (inception to October 2018). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website was utilized for additional information. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant English-language studies and those conducted in humans were considered. DATA SYNTHESIS: β-Lactams alone or in combination are the preferred treatment for many common infections in pregnancy, such as urinary tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), gonococcal infections, syphilis, chancroid, upper- and lower-respiratory-tract infections, certain gastrointestinal infections, Group B Streptococcus, listeriosis, and intrauterine inflammation or infection. Macrolides, particularly azithromycin, are also utilized for the treatment of PID, chlamydia, gonococcal infections, chancroid, community-acquired pneumonia, and certain gastrointestinal infections. Other antibiotics or antivirals such as vancomycin, aminoglycosides, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, acyclovir, valacyclovir, and oseltamivir are included in the preferred therapy for some common bacterial and viral infections in pregnant patients as well. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review synthesizes available evidence of treatments of common infections in pregnancy and provides a concise summary to guide clinicians on empirical treatment during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: There are limited data on clinical outcomes in pregnant patients with common bacterial and viral infections. Empirical management decisions require balance of benefit and risk to both mother and infant. Although few clinical practice guidelines have quality evidence for strong recommendations in this population, clinicians should weigh antimicrobial dosing, pharmacokinetics, safety, and established effectiveness to optimize antimicrobial therapy in pregnancy."
0,Comparison of two identification and susceptibility test kits for Ureaplasma spp and Mycoplasma hominis in amniotic fluid of patients at high risk for intra-amniotic infection,10.1080/14767058.2019.1572742,"Objective: Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis are the most common microorganisms found in the amniotic fluid of patients at risk for preterm delivery. However, culture techniques for genital mycoplasms require special conditions, are barely considered as part of the evaluation of suspected intra-amniotic infection (IAI) and the results are available within 2 and 7 days. The objectives of this study are to validate the use of two commercially available kits (Mycoplasma IES y MYCOFAST® RevolutioN) for the identification of Ureaplasma spp. and Mycoplasma hominis in amniotic fluid, to compare the results of these kits with those obtained by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and to report the antibiotic sensitivity profile of the genital mycoplasms identified.Methods: This is a prospective cohort study including women with singleton and twin gestations between 16 and 36 weeks. Patients were admitted to perform an amniocentesis due to pregnancy complications considered at high risk for IAI (e.g. preterm labor with intact membranes, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, short cervix, etc.), treatment of polyhydramnios, and for the assessment of fetal death and fever without a focus.Results: Overall, 93 patients underwent amniocentesis and 63 had results available for all tests. The prevalence of a positive culture was 6% (4/63). There were four cases of Ureaplasma spp. and none of Mycoplasma hominis. The qPCR identified one case as Ureaplasma spp., one case as Ureaplasma parvum and two cases as Ureaplasma urealyticum. For all tests, the diagnostic performance was as follows: sensitivity 100% [95% CI (39.8-100%)], specificity 100% [95% CI (93.9-100%)], positive predictive value 100% [95% CI (39.8-100%)] and negative predictive value 100% [95% CI (93.9-100%)]. In this cohort, Ureaplasma spp. showed low resistance to erythromycin, but a high resistance to clindamycin and clarithromycin that may change according to the antibiotic concentration.Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study that validates the use of the Mycoplasma IES and MYCOFAST® RevolutioN kits for the identification of genital mycoplasmas in amniotic fluid. The results of these kits are mostly available within 24 hours, have an excellent correlation with those from broth cultures and qPCR and characterize the antibiotic sensitivity profile of the genital mycoplasms identified, providing an opportunity for specific treatment in cases of IAI. Further validation studies in other populations are needed."
0,Evaluation of the performance of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in detection of chlamydia and gonorrhoea infection in vaginal specimens relative to patient infection status: a systematic review,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022510,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) using vaginal specimens in comparison to specimens from the cervix or urine in their ability to detect chlamydia and gonorrhoea infection in women based on patient infection status (PIS). DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: EMBASE and Ovid MEDLINE databases were searched through 3 October 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: We included studies that tested samples from the vagina and ≥1 other site (cervix and/or urine) with ≥2 NAATs for chlamydia and ≥2 NAATs or 1 NAAT and culture for gonorrhoea for each site. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Performance is defined as the sensitivity of a NAAT using a specimen site and PIS of the patient. We assessed risk of bias using modified QUADAS-2. RESULTS: Nine publications met the inclusion criteria (eight for chlamydia; six for gonorrhoea) and were narratively reviewed. Pooled summary estimates were not calculated due to the variable methodology and PIS definitions. Tests performed on vaginal specimens accomplished similar performance to cervical and urine specimens for chlamydia (range of performance estimates: vaginal 65%-100%, cervical 59%-97%, urine 57%-100%) and gonorrhoea (vaginal 64%-100%, cervical 85%-100%, urine 67%-94%). Vaginal specimens were estimated to have a performance >80% for chlamydia and gonorrhoea infections in all but one study. CONCLUSIONS: Performance of the NAATs for chlamydia and gonorrhoea detection using vaginal specimens was similar to that of cervical and urine specimens relative to PIS. As vaginal samples have a higher acceptability and lower cost, the study can support clinical testing guidelines by providing evidence that vaginal samples are a suitable alternative to traditionally used specimens."
0,Is the risk of cervical atypia associated with the interval between menarche and the start of sexual activity? A population-based cohort study,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030091,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether the risk of cervical atypia is associated with a short interval between the age at first sexual intercourse (FSI) or age at the start of oral contraceptive (OC) use and menarche. DESIGN: A population-based cohort study. SETTING: Finnish women in the age range of 16-17 years old were enrolled in the PATRICIA trial of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 vaccine efficacy. PARTICIPANTS: The association of cervical atypia with the interval between FSI or start of OC use and menarche was assessed in the control arm (hepatitis A vaccinated) who had participated in biannual clinical follow-up visits for 4 years. Altogether, 913 women had normal baseline cervical cytology and answered behavioural questionnaires at enrolment and end of the follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: ORs with 95% CIs using univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to assess the association between cervical atypia and the interval between FSI or the start of OC use and menarche. RESULTS: The mean ages at menarche, FSI and the start of OC use were 12.4, 16.0 and 16.4. Chlamydiatrachomatis infection was associated with an increased risk of cervical atypia in women with a short (<3 years) interval between menarche and FSI/start of OC use (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.6 and OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 5.1). Whereas HPV 16/18 infection was associated with increased atypia risk estimates in women with a longer (≥3 years) interval (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.7 and OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.1). In women with a short interval between menarche and FSI, early age at the start of OC use was not associated with an increased risk of cervical atypia in the univariate (OR 0.7) nor multivariable analyses. CONCLUSION: Short interval between menarche and the age at start of sexual activity does not increase the risk of HPV-associated cervical atypia. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00122681."
0,Mediation of Interleukin-23 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-Driven Reactive Arthritis by Chlamydia-Infected Macrophages in SKG Mice,10.1002/art.41653,"OBJECTIVE: ZAP-70W163C BALB/c (SKG) mice develop reactive arthritis (ReA) following infection with Chlamydia muridarum. Since intracellular pathogens enhance their replicative fitness in stressed host cells, we examined how myeloid cells infected with C muridarum drive arthritis. METHODS: SKG, Il17a-deficient SKG, and BALB/c female mice were infected with C muridarum or C muridarum luciferase in the genitals. C muridarum dissemination was assessed by in vivo imaging or genomic DNA amplification. Macrophages were depleted using clodronate liposomes. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) and anti-interleukin-23p19 (anti-IL-23p19) were administered after infection or arthritis onset. Gene expression of Hspa5, Tgtp1, Il23a, Il17a, Il12b, and Tnf was compared in SKG mice and BALB/c mice. RESULTS: One week following infection with C muridarum, macrophages and neutrophils were observed to have infiltrated the uteri of mice and were also shown to have carried C muridarum DNA to the spleen. C muridarum load was higher in SKG mice than in BALB/c mice. Macrophage depletion was shown to reduce C muridarum load and prevent development of arthritis. Compared with BALB/c mice, expression of Il23a and Il17a was increased in the uterine and splenic neutrophils of SKG mice. The presence of anti-IL-23p19 during infection or Il17a deficiency suppressed arthritis. Tnf was overexpressed in the joints of SKG mice within 1 week postinfection, and persisted beyond the first week. TNF inhibition during infection or at arthritis onset suppressed the development of arthritis. Levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress were constitutively increased in the joints of SKG mice but were induced, in conjunction with immunity-related GTPase, by C muridarum infection in the uterus. CONCLUSION: C muridarum load is higher in SKG mice than in BALB/c mice. Whereas proinflammatory IL-23 produced by neutrophils contributes to the initiation of C muridarum-mediated ReA, macrophage depletion reduces C muridarum dissemination to other tissues, tissue burden, and the development of arthritis. TNF inhibition was also shown to suppress arthritis development. Our data suggest that enhanced bacterial dissemination in macrophages of SKG mice drives the TNF production needed for persistent arthritis."
1,"Relation between Chlamydia trachomatis infection and pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility in a Dutch cohort of women previously tested for chlamydia in a chlamydia screening trial",10.1136/sextrans-2018-053778,"OBJECTIVES: A better understanding of Chlamydia trachomatis infection (chlamydia)-related sequelae can provide a framework for effective chlamydia control strategies. The objective of this study was to estimate risks and risk factors of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility (TFI) with a follow-up time of up until 8 years in women previously tested for chlamydia in the Chlamydia Screening Implementation study (CSI) and participating in the Netherlands Chlamydia Cohort Study (NECCST). METHODS: Women who participated in the CSI 2008-2011 (n=13 498) were invited in 2015-2016 for NECCST. Chlamydia positive was defined as a positive CSI-PCR test, positive chlamydia serology and/or self-reported infection (time dependent). Data on PID, ectopic pregnancy and TFI were collected by self-completed questionnaires. Incidence rates and HRs were compared between chlamydia-positive and chlamydia-negative women corrected for confounders. RESULTS: Of 5704 women included, 29.5% (95% CI 28.3 to 30.7) were chlamydia positive. The incidence rate of PID was 1.8 per 1000 person-years (py) (1.6 to 2.2) overall, 4.4 per 1000 py (3.3 to 5.7) among chlamydia positives compared with 1.4 per 1000 py (1.1 to 1.7) for chlamydia negatives. For TFI, this was 0.4 per 1000 py (0.3 to 0.5) overall, 1.3 per 1000 py (0.8 to 2.1) and 0.2 per 1000 py (0.1 to 0.4) among chlamydia positives and negatives, respectively. And for ectopic pregnancy, this was 0.6 per 1000 py (0.5 to 0.8) overall, 0.8 per 1000 py (0.4 to 1.5) and 0.6 per 1000 py (0.4 to 0.8) for chlamydia negatives. Among chlamydia-positive women, the strongest risk factor for PID was symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection (adjusted HR 2.88, 1.4 to 4.5) and for TFI age <20 versus >24 years at first infection (HR 4.35, 1.1 to 16.8). CONCLUSION: We found a considerably higher risk for PID and TFI in chlamydia-positive women, but the incidence for ectopic pregnancy was comparable between chlamydia-positive and chlamydia-negative women. Overall, the incidence rates of sequelae remained low. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR-5597."
1,Vaginal microbiota in ethnically diverse young women who did or did not develop pelvic inflammatory disease: community-based prospective study,10.1136/sextrans-2021-055260,"OBJECTIVES: A lactobacilli-dominated vaginal microbiome may protect against pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), but one dominated by Gardnerella species might increase susceptibility. Not all lactobacilli are equally protective. Recent research suggests that D(-) isomer lactic acid producing lactobacilli (Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus gasseri) may protect against infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, an important cause of PID. Lactobacillus iners , which produces L(+) isomer lactic acid, may be less protective. We investigated the microbiome in stored vaginal samples from participants who did or did not develop PID during the prevention of pelvic infection (POPI) chlamydia screening trial. METHODS: Long-read 16S rRNA gene nanopore sequencing was used on baseline vaginal samples (one per participant) from all 37 women who subsequently developed clinically diagnosed PID during 12-month follow-up, and 111 frequency matched controls who did not, matched on four possible risk factors for PID: age <20 versus ≥20, black ethnicity versus other ethnicity, chlamydia positive versus negative at baseline and ≥2 sexual partners in the previous year versus 0-1 partners. RESULTS: Samples from 106 women (median age 19 years, 40% black ethnicity, 22% chlamydia positive, 54% reporting multiple partners) were suitable for analysis. Three main taxonomic clusters were identified dominated by L. iners, L. crispatus and Gardnerella vaginalis. There was no association between a more diverse, G. vaginalis dominated microbiome and subsequent PID, although increased Shannon diversity was associated with black ethnicity (p=0.002) and bacterial vaginosis (diagnosed by Gram stain p<0.0001). Women who developed PID had similar relative abundance of protective D(-) isomer lactic acid producing lactobacilli to women without PID, but numbers of PID cases were small. CONCLUSIONS: In the first-ever community-based prospective study of PID, there was no clear association between the vaginal microbiome and subsequent development of PID. Future studies using serial samples may identify vaginal microbial communities that may predispose to PID."
1,Identification of novel microbes associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility,10.1136/sextrans-2015-052285,"OBJECTIVES: As pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) aetiology is not completely understood, we examined the relationship between select novel bacteria, PID and long-term sequelae. METHODS: Fastidious bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated bacteria (Sneathia (Leptotrichia) sanguinegens, Sneathia amnionii, Atopobium vaginae and BV-associated bacteria 1 (BVAB1)), as well as Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum were identified in cervical and endometrial specimens using organism-specific PCR assays among 545 women enrolled in the PID Evaluation and Clinical Health study. Risk ratios and 95% CIs were constructed to determine associations between bacteria, histologically confirmed endometritis, recurrent PID and infertility, adjusting for age, race, gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Infertility models were additionally adjusted for baseline infertility. RESULTS: Persistent detection of BV-associated bacteria was common (range 58% for A. vaginae to 82% for BVAB1) and elevated the risk for persistent endometritis (RRadj 8.5, 95% CI 1.6 to 44.6) 30 days post-cefoxitin/doxycycline treatment, independent of gonorrhoea and chlamydia. In models adjusted for gonorrhoea and chlamydia, endometrial BV-associated bacteria were associated with recurrent PID (RRadj 4.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 12.8), and women who tested positive in the cervix and/or endometrium were more likely to develop infertility (RRadj 3.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 10.4). Associations between ureaplasmas and PID sequelae were modest. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to demonstrate that S. sanguinegens, S. amnionii, BVAB1 and A. vaginae are associated with PID, failure of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended treatment to eliminate short-term endometritis, recurrent PID and infertility. Optimal antibiotic regimens for PID may require coverage of novel BV-associated microbes."
0,Cationic cell-penetrating peptide is bactericidal against Neisseria gonorrhoeae,10.1093/jac/dkz339,"OBJECTIVES: Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been evaluated for intracellular delivery of molecules and several CPPs have bactericidal activity. Our objectives were to determine the effect of a 12 amino acid CPPs on survival and on the invasive and inflammatory potential of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. METHODS: Survival of MDR and human challenge strains of N. gonorrhoeae grown in cell culture medium with 10% FBS was determined after treatment with the CPP and human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 for 4 h. Confocal microscopy was used to examine penetration of FITC-labelled CPP into bacterial cells. The ability of the CPP to prevent invasion of human ME-180 cervical epithelial cells and to reduce the induction of TNF-α in human THP-1 monocytic cells in response to gonococcal infection was assessed. Cytotoxicity of the CPP towards the THP-1 cells was determined. RESULTS: The CPP was bactericidal, with 95%-100% killing of all gonococcal strains at 100 μM. Confocal microscopy of gonococci incubated with FITC-labelled CPP revealed the penetration of the peptide. CPP treatment of N. gonorrhoeae inhibited gonococcal invasion of ME-180 cells and reduced the expression of TNF-α induced in THP-1 cells by gonococci. The CPP showed no cytotoxicity towards human THP-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these promising results, future studies will focus on testing of CPP in the presence of other types of host cells and exploration of structural modifications of the CPP that could decrease its susceptibility to proteolysis and increase its potency."
0,Sexually Transmitted Infection Diagnoses at Children's Hospitals During COVID-19.,10.1542/hpeds.2022-006750,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 mitigation strategies resulted in changes in health care access and utilization, which could negatively impact adolescents at risk for  sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We evaluated changes in STI diagnoses  during adolescent visits at children's hospitals during COVID-19. METHODS: We  conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information  System database comparing adolescent (11-18 years) hospital visits with an STI  diagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, code during  COVID-19 (2020) to pre-COVID-19 (2017-2019). Data were divided into spring (March  15-May 31), summer (June 1-August 31), and fall (September 1-December 31). Median  weekly visits and patient characteristics were compared using median regression.  RESULTS: Of 2 747 135 adolescent encounters, there were 10 941 encounters with an  STI diagnosis from 44 children's hospitals in 2020. There was a decrease in  overall median weekly visits for STIs in spring during COVID-19 (n = -18.6%, P =  .001) and an increase in overall visits in summer (11%, P = .002) during  COVID-19. There were significant increases in inpatient median weekly visits for  STIs in summer (30%, P = .001) and fall (27%, P = .003) during COVID-19. We found  increases in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (50%, P < .001) and other STI diagnoses  (defined as other or unspecified STI by International Classification of Diseases,  10th revision, code; 38%, P = .040) in fall COVID-19 (2020), and a decrease in  pelvic inflammatory disease (-28%, P = .032) in spring COVID-19 (2020).  CONCLUSIONS: We found increases in median weekly adolescent inpatient visits with  an STI diagnosis in summer and fall COVID-19 (2020). These findings were likely  partially driven by changes in behaviors or health care access. Further work is  needed to improve STI care and thus potentially improve related health outcomes."
0,Changing patterns of disseminated gonococcal infection in France: cross-sectional data 2009-2011,10.1136/sextrans-2013-051119,"OBJECTIVES: Disseminated gonococcal infections (DGIs) are rare. We describe the characteristics of DGIs in France. METHODS: This is a 3-year retrospective analysis of DGI cases collected through two networks of microbiologists and infectious disease specialists in France between 2009 and 2011. DGI was defined either by the isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from blood and synovial fluid or by the existence of a clinical syndrome consistent with DGI and the isolation of N gonorrhoeae from any site. We describe the epidemiological, clinical and microbiological characteristics and outcomes of DGIs. RESULTS: 21 patients (9 women, 12 men; 18-62 years old) were diagnosed with DGI. The number of DGI cases increased between 2009 and 2011. Two men who had sex with men were coinfected with HIV. We found 28 extragenital locations, including arthritis (14 cases), tenosynovitis (7), skin lesions (4), endocarditis (1), prostatitis (1) and pelvic inflammatory disease (1). Genital signs were present in five patients. The diagnosis was confirmed by cultures in 20 patients-blood (4), synovial fluid (11), genital (3), throat (1), urine (1)-and by molecular biology on a pharyngeal swab in 1 patient. Seven cases were resistant to fluoroquinolones. The patients were treated with ceftriaxone, associated with corticosteroids (two cases) and surgery (six cases). Four patients had joint sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: DGIs are increasing. Men seem to be at higher risk than women. Joint involvement was common. Microbiological diagnosis was based on culture, however molecular biology using pharyngeal swabs was helpful when cultures were negative."
0,Detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae with the cobas CT/NG v2.0 test: performance compared with the BD ProbeTec CT Qx and GC Qx amplified DNA and Aptima AC2 assays,10.1136/sextrans-2018-053545,"OBJECTIVES: Infections due to Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) are among the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infections worldwide, most of which are asymptomatic. Detection of infection using a variety of specimen types in symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects is important to effectively combat CT/NG infections. The performance of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 test was assessed for urogenital swabs, urine and cervical cytology samples collected in PreservCyt Solution from 5266 symptomatic and asymptomatic women (including 202 who were pregnant), and urine from 738 men. METHODS: Sensitivity and specificity were estimated compared with a patient infected status determined using two US Food and Drug Administration-cleared nucleic acid amplification tests. RESULTS: Among 6004 participants, 487 CT (8.1%) and 159 NG (2.6%) infections were identified. Sensitivity estimates for CT for women ranged from 91.2% to 97.6% depending on specimen type, and the estimate for male urine specimens was 98.4%. Specificity for CT ranged from 99.2% to 99.7%. Sensitivity estimates for NG ranged from 95.6% to 100.0% for women, and the estimate for men was 100.0%. Specificity for NG ranged from 99.3% to 100.0%. CONCLUSIONS: The cobas CT/NG v2.0 test performs well using urogenital swabs, urine and cervical samples collected in PreservCyt solution."
0,Cervical ectopy: associations with sexually transmitted infections and HIV. A cross-sectional study of high school students in rural South Africa,10.1136/sextrans-2014-051674,"OBJECTIVES: It has been hypothesised that ectopy may be associated with increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In this cross-sectional study, we wanted to explore the association between STIs (including HIV) and cervical ectopy. METHODS: We included 700 sexually active young women attending randomly selected high schools in a rural district in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The district is endemic of HIV and has a high prevalence of STIs. We did computer-assisted measurements of the ectocervical area covered by columnar epithelium (ectopy) in colposcopic images and STI analyses on cervicovaginal lavage and serum samples. All participating women answered a questionnaire about sexual behaviour and use of contraceptives. RESULTS: The mean age was 19.1 years. Ectopy was found in 27.2%, HIV in 27.8%, chlamydia in 25.3% and gonorrhoea in 15.6%. We found that age, parity, chlamydia and gonorrhoea, years since menarche, years since sexual debut and number of sexual partners were associated with ectopy. In multivariate analysis with chlamydia infection as the dependent variable, women with ectopy had increased odds of having chlamydia infection (adjusted OR 1.78, p=0.033). In women under 19 years of age, we found twofold higher odds of being HIV-positive for those with ectopy (OR 2.19, p=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, cervical ectopy is associated with Chlamydia trachomatis infection and HIV in the youngest women."
1,Pelvic inflammatory disease and causative pathogens in older women in a medical center in eastern Taiwan: A retrospective cross-sectional study,10.1371/journal.pone.0257627,"OBJECTIVES: Most research into the management of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is in younger women and focuses on sexually transmitted pathogens such as N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis. Non-sexually transmitted bacterial pathogens and PID in older women are rarely examined. The objective of this study is to explore cervical culture pathogens in women of different age groups in a medical center in eastern Taiwan. METHODS: We enrolled patients whose medical records were diagnosed with PID (ICD-9-CM 614.0 [N70.01-03], 614.1[N70.11-13], 614.9 [N73.5, N73.9]) at our hospital from October 2014 to March 2020. Patients were divided into three groups according to age: the age <25 years, age 25-44 years, and the ≥ 45 years group. Chi-square test, ANOVA and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. In subgroup analysis, endocervical pathogens were further stratified into vaginal, respiratory, enteric, skin, oral, and other. RESULTS: A total of 96 patients were included in the study. There were 31 patients in the age ≥ 45 years group, 52 patients in the age 25-44 years group, and 13 patients in the age <25 years group. Vagina and enteric pathogens were the most common pathogens among all groups. The isolated respiratory and other pathogens were more in the age ≥ 45 years group than in the other two groups. Prevotella bivia was more common in the age <25 years and 25-44 years groups. CONCLUSIONS: This may be due to different pathogeneses of PID in the age ≥ 45 years patients. Our study can be used as a reference for antibiotic choice of non-sexually transmitted PID and to prevent long-term sequelae of PID."
1,A cross-sectional study showing differences in the clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease according to the experience of clinicians: implications for training and audit,10.1136/sextrans-2014-051646,"OBJECTIVES: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) generates diagnostic difficulty even for experienced doctors. Junior doctors and nurses also assess women with symptoms suggestive of PID. We aimed to determine if and how PID diagnoses vary between clinicians with different experience levels. METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted in U.K. sexual health clinic, nested within a Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), and Neisseria gonorrhoea diagnostic test accuracy study. Proportions and characteristics of women diagnosed clinically with PID by clinicians with varying experience were compared. Outcomes included demographics, presenting symptoms and signs and CT, and CT and/or gonococcal (GC) (CT/GC) positivity. RESULTS: In 3804 women assessed by 36 clinicians, rates of PID, CT and GC were 4.4%, 10.5%, and 2.5%, with no differences between experienced and inexperienced clinicians (p=0.84, p=0.13 and p=0.07, respectively). 63.7% of PID diagnosed by experienced clinicians met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) key clinical criteria versus 41.2% by inexperienced; experienced versus inexperienced OR 2.51; 95% CI 1.16 to 5.40). Proportions of CT (CT/GC)-positive PID increased with experience (5.9% (11.8%) to 31.9% (34.1%)); experienced versus inexperienced (OR 3.90; 95% CI 1.12 to 13.5). Percentages of women with CT (CT/GC) who were diagnosed with PID also rose with experience (2.2% (3.9%) to 14.2% (13.7%)), but CT prevalence in PID cases diagnosed by inexperienced clinicians (8.8%) was no greater than in all women they assessed (9.0%), suggesting poorer discriminative skills. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical diagnostic acumen for PID improves with experience. Inexperienced clinicians should focus on the presence of lower abdominal pain with pelvic tenderness and consider additional supportive symptoms, to improve specificity of their diagnoses.

0,Population attributable fraction of pelvic inflammatory disease associated with chlamydia and gonorrhoea: a cross-sectional analysis of Australian sexual health clinic data,10.1136/sextrans-2015-052195,"OBJECTIVES: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an important cause of female infertility and can occur when micro-organisms such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea ascend to the upper genital tract. PID has been used as an outcome measure in chlamydia screening trials; however, few data have quantified the PID burden that could be avoided by preventing chlamydia. We estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of PID associated with a current chlamydia or gonorrhoea infection among females 16-49 years attending an Australian sexual health clinic (SHC) (2006-2013). METHODS: Using multivariable logistic regression, PAF estimates were adjusted for age and behavioural factors. Two separate analyses were undertaken: one among 'chlamydia-tested' women and one among a subset of chlamydia-tested women who were also tested for gonorrhoea ('chlamydia+gonorrhoea-tested'). A sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation was conducted to assess the impact of missing data on results. RESULTS: Among 15 690 chlamydia-tested women, 1279 (8.2%, 95% CI 7.7% to 8.6%) were chlamydia positive, 436 (2.8%, 95% CI 2.5% to 3.0%) had PID diagnosed and the adjusted PAF for chlamydia was 14.1% (95% CI 9.9% to 18.0%). Among the chlamydia+gonorrhoea-tested subset (n=8839), 681 (7.7%, 95% CI 7.2% to 8.3%) tested positive for chlamydia only, 30 (0.3%, 95% CI 0.2% to 0.5%) for gonorrhoea only, 22 (0.2%, 95% CI 0.2% to 0.4%) for chlamydia and gonorrhoea and 419 (4.7%, 95% CI 4.3% to 5.2%) had PID diagnosed. The adjusted PAF was highest for chlamydia only (12.4%, 95% CI 8.4% to 16.2%) compared with gonorrhoea only (0.9%, 95% CI -0.1% to 1.8%) or concurrent infections (1.0%, 95% CI 0.0% to 1.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In this high chlamydia prevalence SHC population, eliminating a current chlamydia infection might at most reduce PID by about 14%."
1,Characteristics of pelvic inflammatory disease where no sexually transmitted infection is identified: a cross-sectional analysis of routinely collected sexual health clinic data,10.1136/sextrans-2016-052553,"OBJECTIVES: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) occurs when pathogens, often sexually transmitted, ascend to the upper genital tract, yet a causative pathogen is not detected in a substantial proportion of diagnosed PID. We assessed the characteristics associated with PID in women in whom chlamydia, gonorrhoea, Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) were not detected ('pathogen-negative-PID'). METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of routinely collected clinical data from new female patients attending a sexual health clinic between 2006 and 2013. Women were eligible if they had been diagnosed with PID and tested for genital chlamydia, gonorrhoea, MG and BV. Logistic regression was conducted to identify characteristics associated with pathogen-negative-PID. RESULTS: Among 330 women with clinically diagnosed PID, 204 (61.8%, 95% CI 56.3% to 67.1%) had pathogen-negative-PID. Compared with pathogen-positive-PID, pathogen-negative-PID cases were more likely to be aged ≥30 years (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.7, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.0), had less evidence of vaginal inflammation (AOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9) and reported less unprotected sex (AOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight uncertainties around PID diagnosis and aetiology. Pathogen-negative-PID could represent (i) a false positive diagnosis where the woman does not have a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or PID, (ii) PID of another microbiological aetiology or associated with a past STI or (iii) PID where the cervical infection has cleared. However, until diagnostic biomarkers are available, PID treatment should be based on clinical features and sexual risk."
0,Point-of-care testing for chlamydia and gonorrhoea: implications for clinical practice,10.1371/journal.pone.0100518,"OBJECTIVES: Point-of-care (POC) testing for chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhoea (NG) offers a new approach to the diagnosis and management of these sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in remote Australian communities and other similar settings. Diagnosis of STIs in remote communities is typically symptom driven, and for those who are asymptomatic, treatment is generally delayed until specimens can be transported to the reference laboratory, results returned and the patient recalled. The objective of this study was to explore the clinical implications of using CT/NG POC tests in routine clinical care in remote settings. METHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposively selected group of 18 key informants with a range of sexual health and laboratory expertise. RESULTS: Participants highlighted the potential impact POC testing would have on different stages of the current STI management pathway in remote Aboriginal communities and how the pathway would change. They identified implications for offering a POC test, specimen collection, conducting the POC test, syndromic management of STIs, pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosis and management, interpretation and delivery of POC results, provision of treatment, contact tracing, management of client flow and wait time, and re-testing at 3 months after infection. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of POC testing to improve STI service delivery requires careful consideration of both its advantages and limitations. The findings of this study will inform protocols for the implementation of CT/NG POC testing, and also STI testing and management guidelines."
0,Bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling,10.1016/j.jinf.2014.04.006,"OBJECTIVES: Sexually transmitted infections are a significant cause of genital disease, infertility and hospital admissions. The economic impact is high. An accurate diagnosis is often difficult and time consuming. We report the development and validation of a novel bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling (STIP) assay that detects 18 sexually transmitted infections using a multiplex PCR followed by Luminex bead-based hybridisation. METHODS: STIP was validated using urogenital samples pretested by commercially available quantitative PCR, microscopy or by culturing methods. RESULTS: STIP specifically detects Chlamydia trachomatis, Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma (M.) genitalium, M. hominis, M. pneumonia, M. spermatophilum, Ureaplasma urealyticum and U. parvum, and quantifies bacterial vaginosis-associated Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis as well as three Candida species and normal genital flora-associated Lactobacillus species. STIP reached an overall concordance of 95-100% with commercially available quantitative PCR tests. Compared to Nugent score, STIP reached a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 86% for bacterial vaginosis detection. Candida specimens, pretested by direct culturing, were identified with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 99%. CONCLUSIONS: STIP is a powerful high-throughput tool in assessing a broad spectrum of urogenital infections."
0,Cervicitis aetiology and case definition: a study in Australian women attending sexually transmitted infection clinics,10.1136/sextrans-2015-052332,"OBJECTIVES: Studies examining cervicitis aetiology and prevalence lack comparability due to varying criteria for cervicitis. We aimed to outline cervicitis associations and suggest a best case definition. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 558 women at three sexually transmitted infection clinics in Sydney, Australia, 2006-2010, examined pathogen and behavioural associations of cervicitis using three cervicitis definitions: 'microscopy' (>30 pmnl/hpf (polymorphonuclear leucocytes per high-powered field on cervical Gram stain)), 'cervical discharge' (yellow and/or mucopurulent cervical discharge) or 'micro+cervical discharge' (combined 'microscopy' and 'cervical discharge'). RESULTS: Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) had the strongest associations with cervicitis definitions 'micro+cervical discharge': CT adjusted prevalence ratio (APR)=2.13 (95% CI 1.38 to 3.30) p=0.0006, MG APR=2.21 (1.33 to 3.69) p=0.002, TV APR=2.37 (1.44 to 3.90) p=0.0007 NG PR=4.42 (3.79 to 5.15) p<0.0001 and 'cervical discharge': CT APR=1.90 (1.25 to 2.89) p=0.003, MG APR=1.93 (1.17 to 3.19) p=0.011, TV APR=2.02 (1.24 to 3.31) p=0.005 NG PR=3.88 (3.36 to 4.48) p<0.0001. Condom use for vaginal sex 'always/sometimes' reduced cervicitis risk: ('micro+cervical discharge') APR=0.69 (0.51 to 0.93) p=0.016. Combined population attributable risk % (PAR%) of these four pathogens was only 18.0% with a protective PAR% of condoms of 25.7%. Exposures not associated with cervicitis included bacterial vaginosis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, herpes simplex virus 1&2, cytomegalovirus, Candida, age, smoking and hormonal contraception. CONCLUSIONS: Cervicitis was associated with CT, MG, TV and NG with combined PAR% of these pathogens only 18% in this setting, suggesting other factors are involved. Condoms significantly reduced cervicitis risk. Cervicitis definitions with best clinical utility and pathogen prediction were 'cervical discharge' and 'micro+cervical discharge'."
0,"Prevalence of human papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections among female sex workers in Togo: a national cross-sectional survey",10.1016/j.cmi.2019.04.015,"OBJECTIVES: Sub-Saharan Africa is a region with high incidence of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cervical cancer. We conducted the first national study in Togo to assess prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among female sex workers (FSW). METHODS: A multicentric cross-sectional study was conducted among FSW recruited in hot spots (clubs, streets) in four Togolese cities. HPV and STIs were tested from cervical and anal swabs. HIV and syphilis were screened with rapid tests. RESULTS: In all, 310 FSW were recruited; HIV and cervical high-risk HPV (hrHPV) prevalence were 10.6% (33/310) and 32.9% (102/310), respectively. The most frequent hrHPV types were HPV58 (13.6%, 19/140), HPV35 (12.9%, 18/140), HPV31 (12.1%, 17/140) and HPV16 (10.7%, 15/140). Prevalence of hrHPV and multiple hrHPV infections showed higher rates in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative FSW (48.5% versus 31.0%, p 0.04 and 21.2% versus 9.0%, p 0.03; respectively). Prevalence of hrHPV was higher in cervical than anal swabs (34.1% versus 20.7%, p 0.0004). High-risk HPV anal infections were more frequent among HIV-positive than HIV-negative FSW (51.9% versus 17.3%, p 2 × 10-5). Concomitant anal and cervical hrHPV infections were present in 43.2% (41/95) of hrHPV-positive FSW. Overall prevalence in the cervix of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium and Trichomonas vaginalis were 4.2%, 6.1%, 5.5% and 6.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This first African study on paired cervical and anal samples showed a high prevalence of genital HPV infections with a rather high rate of concomitant HPV infections but low type concordance. We report an unusual distribution of hrHPV types. These findings highlight the critical need for implementation of a national HPV vaccination strategy."
0,"Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae co-infections among patients with newly diagnosed syphilis: a single-centre, cross-sectional study",10.21101/cejph.a5142,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae co-infections among patients with newly diagnosed syphilis. METHODS: In patients with any stage of newly diagnosed syphilis swabs were performed from urethra, rectum, pharynx and cervix according to the gender and type of sexual intercourse. From these smears standard validated nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections were done. RESULTS: From 548 (488 men, 60 women) screened patients co-infection was detected in 15.9% of the cases. The majority of the co-infections (86.2%) were asymptomatic. The overall prevalence of chlamydial infection was 11.1% and 8.8% for gonococcal infections. In men who have sex with men (MSM) the prevalence of co-infections was significantly higher (20.0%) than in heterosexual men and women (4.2%) (p < 0.001). In MSM patients the presence of co-infection was significantly associated with HIV infection (p < 0.001). Among MSM 9.6% of the tests detected infection in anorectal site, while prevalence in urethral (2.8%) and pharyngeal (2.4%) localization was significantly lower. In heterosexual patients prevalence was less than 2.0% in all anatomic sites. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of screening tests in case of sexually transmitted infections in patients with newly diagnosed syphilis is an important part in the management of this disease. These results suggest that screening of asymptomatic heterosexual patients leads to detection of minimum co-infections, but in MSM (especially HIV positive) should always be performed at least in anorectal site, where asymptomatic co-infections are common."
0,HIV-1 co-receptor expression and epithelial immune cells of the cervix in asymptomatic women attending a genitourinary medicine clinic,10.1111/hiv.12002,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to qualitatively and semiquantitatively characterize the expression of the principal HIV co-receptors chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) on susceptible CD4 T-helper cell, monocyte/macrophage and Langerhans dendritic cell populations within the cervical epithelia of asymptomatic women attending a genitourinary medicine clinic. METHODS: Of 77 asymptomatic women recruited, 35 were excluded: 21 because they were found to have bacterial vaginosis, eight because they were found to have candida and six for other reasons. Cervical cytobrush samples from 11 women with Chlamydia trachomatis infection and 31 women without any detectable genital infection were stained with fluorescently labelled antibodies specific for cell surface CCR5, CXCR4, CD4, CD3, CD1a and CD19 expression, then analysed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: CD4/CD3 T-helper cells (84%), CD1a Langerhans dendritic cells (75%) and CD4/CD14 monocytes/macrophages (59%) were detected in the samples. CCR5 and CXCR4 HIV co-receptor expression was observed on 46-86% of the above subsets. CD1a cells exhibited significantly higher CCR5 and CXCR4 positivity and median fluorescence than CD4 cells and higher CXCR4 positivity and median fluorescence than CD14 cells (P < 0.05 or less). Increased detection of CCR5 over CXCR4 was seen in CD14 cells (P < 0.05). No significant differences in CCR5 or CXCR4 expression were found in samples from asymptomatic women with or without chlamydial infection. CONCLUSIONS: Co-receptor expression confirms the potential for CD1a Langerhans cells, monocytes/macrophages and T-helper cells in the cervix as primary targets for HIV infection. Previously observed selective transmission of CCR5-tropic isolates cannot be accounted for by a lack of CXCR4-expressing CD4 cervical immune cells. We were unable to identify any specific impact of chlamydial infection on co-receptor expression in this study."
1,Where to go to in chlamydia control? From infection control towards infectious disease control,10.1136/sextrans-2021-054992,"OBJECTIVES: The clinical and public health relevance of widespread case finding by testing for asymptomatic chlamydia infections is under debate. We wanted to explore future directions for chlamydia control and generate insights that might guide for evidence-based strategies. In particular, we wanted to know the extent to which we should pursue testing for asymptomatic infections at both genital and extragenital sites. METHODS: We synthesised findings from published literature and from discussions among national and international chlamydia experts during an invitational workshop. We described changing perceptions in chlamydia control to inform the development of recommendations for future avenues for chlamydia control in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Despite implementing a range of interventions to control chlamydia, there is no practice-based evidence that population prevalence can be reduced by screening programmes or widespread opportunistic testing. There is limited evidence about the beneficial effect of testing on pelvic inflammatory disease prevention. The risk of tubal factor infertility resulting from chlamydia infection is low and evidence on the preventable fraction remains uncertain. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment with antibiotics for self-limiting and non-viable infections have contributed to antimicrobial resistance in other pathogens and may affect oral, anal and genital microbiota. These changing insights could affect the outcome of previous cost-effectiveness analysis. CONCLUSION: The balance between benefits and harms of widespread testing to detect asymptomatic chlamydia infections is changing. The opinion of our expert group deviates from the existing paradigm of 'test and treat' and suggests that future strategies should reduce, rather than expand, the role of widespread testing for asymptomatic chlamydia infections."
1,Hospitalisations for pelvic inflammatory disease temporally related to a diagnosis of Chlamydia or gonorrhoea: a retrospective cohort study,10.1371/journal.pone.0094361,"OBJECTIVES: The presence and severity of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) symptoms are thought to vary by microbiological etiology but there is limited empirical evidence. We sought to estimate and compare the rates of hospitalisation for PID temporally related to diagnoses of gonorrhoea and chlamydia. METHODS: All women, aged 15-45 years in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), with a diagnosis of chlamydia or gonorrhoea between 01/07/2000 and 31/12/2008 were followed by record linkage for up to one year after their chlamydia or gonorrhoea diagnosis for hospitalisations for PID. Standardised incidence ratios compared the incidence of PID hospitalisations to the age-equivalent NSW population. RESULTS: A total of 38,193 women had a chlamydia diagnosis, of which 483 were hospitalised for PID; incidence rate (IR) 13.9 per 1000 person-years of follow-up (PYFU) (95%CI 12.6-15.1). In contrast, 1015 had a gonorrhoea diagnosis, of which 45 were hospitalised for PID (IR 50.8 per 1000 PYFU, 95%CI 36.0-65.6). The annual incidence of PID hospitalisation temporally related to a chlamydia or gonorrhoea diagnosis was 27.0 (95%CI 24.4-29.8) and 96.6 (95%CI 64.7-138.8) times greater, respectively, than the age-equivalent NSW female population. Younger age, socio-economic disadvantage, having a diagnosis prior to 2005 and having a prior birth were also associated with being hospitalised for PID. CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia and gonorrhoea are both associated with large increases in the risk of PID hospitalisation. Our data suggest the risk of PID hospitalisation is much higher for gonorrhoea than chlamydia; however, further research is needed to confirm this finding."
0,Factors associated with anorectal Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae test positivity in women: a systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1136/sextrans-2018-053950,"OBJECTIVES: There has been considerable discussion about anorectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in women, with some calling for anorectal CT screening, but little about anorectal Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG). Given that urogenital NG is more strongly associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, this is an evidence gap. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the associations between anorectal CT in women and CT positivity at other sites (urogenital/oropharyngeal) and with anal intercourse, and compares these with anorectal NG within the same study populations. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for English-language studies published to October 2018 using the following terms: (""Chlamydia"" OR ""Chlamydia trachomatis"") AND ((""anal"" OR ""rect*"" OR ""anorect*"") OR (""extra?genital"" OR ""multi?site"")). Studies were included if anorectal NG data were available. Random-effects meta-analyses calculated pooled estimates; heterogeneity was investigated using meta-regression. RESULTS: 25 studies were eligible. Anorectal CT positivity ranged from 0% to 17.5%, with a summary estimate of 8.0% (95% CI 7.0 to 9.1; I2=88.5%). Anorectal NG positivity ranged from 0% to 17.0%, with a summary estimate of 2.1% (95% CI 1.6 to 2.8; I2=92.7%). The association between urogenital and anorectal positivity was stronger for NG than CT (summary prevalence ratio (PR)=89.3 (95% CI 53.1 to 150.3; I2=80.1%), PR=32.2 (95% CI 25.6 to 40.7; I2=70.3%), respectively), and between oropharyngeal and anorectal positivity it was stronger for NG than CT (PR=34.8 (95% CI 10.2 to 118.2; I2=89.9%), PR=8.8 (95% CI 6.8 to 11.5; I2=58.1%), respectively). Anal intercourse was associated with anorectal NG (PR=4.3; 95% CI 2.2 to 8.6; I2=0.0%) but not with anorectal CT (PR=1.0; 95% CI 0.7 to 1.4; I2=0.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Anorectal CT is more common than anorectal NG, but anorectal NG is more strongly associated with anal intercourse, urogenital and oropharyngeal NG, suggesting that ongoing discussion about anorectal CT should also include NG. Longitudinal data are required to further understanding of the aetiology of anorectal STIs and assess whether anorectal screening is needed in women. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42df017080188."
0,Comparative effectiveness of a rapid point-of-care test for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis among women in a clinical setting,10.1136/sextrans-2011-050355,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a promising new point-of-care (POC) chlamydia test with traditional nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), and to determine the characteristics that would make a POC test most cost-effective. METHODS: A decision tree was constructed to model chlamydia screening visits to a sexually transmitted disease clinic by a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 women. The model incorporated programmatic screening costs, treatment costs and medical costs averted through prevention of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and its sequelae. Parameter values and costs were estimated for each node in the decision tree based on primary data, published data and unpublished health data. RESULTS: For the base-case scenario (POC sensitivity 92.9%; 47.5% of women willing to wait 40 min for test results; test cost $33.48), POC was estimated to save US$5050 for each case of PID averted compared with NAAT. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that POC would dominate NAAT if the POC test cost is <US$41.52 or if POC sensitivity is ≥ 87.1%. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Monte Carlo simulations, 10 000 iterations), 10.8% of iterations indicated that the POC strategy dominated the NAAT strategy. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio indicated that the POC strategy would save US$28 in total, and avert 14 PID cases. CONCLUSIONS: A promising new chlamydia POC test is likely to be cost-effective compared with traditional NAAT. The POC test sensitivity, cost and proportion of women willing to wait for the POC test result are key elements to determining the cost-effectiveness of any new POC test strategy."
0,Community pharmacy and cash reward: a winning combination for chlamydia screening?,10.1136/sextrans-2011-050357,"OBJECTIVES: To date, the uptake of chlamydia screening in community pharmacies has been limited. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine if a cash reward, offered to both the provider and the consumer of chlamydia screening, increased the uptake of screening in community pharmacies. METHODS: During 4 weeks in 2011, chlamydia screening and education were offered in four city and two suburban pharmacies to people aged 16-30 years. Those who provided a urine sample for testing, contact details, and completed a brief questionnaire were rewarded with $A10. Positive participants, and their nominated contacts, were offered treatment. RESULTS: Over a period of 751.5 h, 979 testing kits were requested, and 900 (93%) urine samples returned. Using probabilistic linkage methods, we determined that 671/900 (75%) urine samples were from unique individuals. 0.9 unique samples were obtained/hour of screening, 63% of which were provided by men. 19/671 (2.8%; 95% CI 1.7% to 4.4%) people tested positive, 5.2% (95% CI 2.8% to 8.8%) of women, and 1.4% (1.4 0.5 to 3.1) of men. 11/19 (58%) people were contacted and treated-two for suspected pelvic inflammatory disease. CONCLUSIONS: Providing a cash reward to encourage chlamydia screening in community pharmacies resulted in greater participation rates than previously reported pharmacy-based studies, particularly among men. Easily implemented mechanisms to reduce inappropriate repeat screening, incorrect contact details and effects on pharmacy work flow may enhance the efficiency of this approach."
1,[Pelvic inflammatory diseases: Microbiologic diagnosis - CNGOF and SPILF Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases Guidelines],10.1016/j.gofs.2019.03.007,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the microorganisms potentially involved in pelvic inflammatory diseases (PIDs) and the different diagnostic methods of PID. METHODS: PubMed and International Guidelines search. RESULTS: PIDs have various microbial causes. The pathogenic role of the main agents of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium is well demonstrated (NP1). C. trachomatis is the most commonly described bacterium in PID (NP1), especially in women under 30 years old. PIDs also occur in situations that decrease the effectiveness of the cervix microbiological lock, such as bacterial vaginosis, allowing facultative vaginal bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and anaerobes to ascend to the uterine cavity. Nevertheless, participation of the diverse bacteria of the vaginal microbiota, in particular anaerobes, and the polymicrobial character of PIDs are still differently appreciated. In the case of uncomplicated PID, to obtain a microbiological diagnosis, endocervical sampling is recommended during gynecological examination under speculum (grade B). A first swab allows for a smear on a slide for direct examination (Gram, MGG). A second swab, in an adapted transport medium, is useful for standard culture with N. gonorrhoeae and facultative vaginal flora bacteria cultures, with antibiotic susceptibility testing. A third swab, in an appropriate transport medium, allows for the search for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and if possible M. genitalium by nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs), (NP1). It is possible to only use one swab in a transport medium suitable for (i) survival of bacteria and (ii) NAATs. When the diagnosis of PID is clinically compatible, a positive NAAT for one or more of the three STI-associated bacteria on a genital sample supports the PID diagnosis (NP1). On the other hand, a negative NAAT does not allow the exclusion of an STI agent for PID diagnosis (NP1). In situations where speculum use is not possible, vaginal sampling will be performed by default. In case of complicated IGH, tuboperitoneal samples can be performed either radiologically or surgically. Since these sites are sterile, any bacteria present will be considered pathogenic (NP2). C. trachomatis serology is not interesting as a first line diagnostic tool for PID diagnosis and is not useful for monitoring the evolution of PID (NP1)."
0,Prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Mycoplasma genitalium among STI clinic attendees in Western Canada: a cross-sectional analysis,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016300,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and correlates of Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) infection among men and women, determine the prevalence of gene mutations conferring resistance and compare test performance of female specimen types. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on specimens collected for gonorrhoea (NG, Neisseria gonorrhoeae) and chlamydia (CT, Chlamydia trachomatis) among male and female Alberta STI clinic attendees using the M. genitalium transcription-mediated amplification-research use only test. Positive specimens were sequenced for 23SrRNA, parC and gyrA genes. Gender-stratified analysis compared test results using χ2 or Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression. Female endocervical and urine specimens were compared. RESULTS: A total of 2254 individuals were tested; 53.8% (n=1212) were male. Male prevalence of MG was 5.3%; CT was 5.9% and NG was 1.8%. Correlates of male infection were a non-gonococcal urethritis diagnosis and NG coinfection. MG prevalence for women was 7.2%; CT was 5.8% and NG was 1.8%. Correlates of female infection were younger age, Indigenous/Other ethnicity and CT/NG coinfection. Nearly two-thirds of eligible specimens had mutations associated with macrolide resistance and 12.2% of specimens had a parC mutation signifying possible moxifloxacin resistance. There was high concordance (98.1%) of results between urine and endocervical swabs. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of MG relative to CT and NG supports the incorporation of MG testing into routine sexually transmissible infection screening. The high rate of resistance to macrolides and moxifloxacin raises concerns about treatment options. The good concordance of results between urine and endocervical swabs supports the use of female urine specimens for testing."
1,[Follow-up and counselling after pelvic inflammatory disease: CNGOF and SPILF Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases Guidelines],10.1016/j.gofs.2019.03.009,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the procedures for follow-up and counselling of patients after pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). METHODS: A search in the Cochrane database, PubMed, and Google was performed using keywords related to follow-up and PID to identify reports published between 1990 and 2018. All studies published in French and English relevant to the areas of focus were included. A level of evidence (LE) based on the quality of the data available was applied for each area of focus and used for the guidelines. RESULTS: The rate of recurrent PID is 15 to 21%. They are related to a recurrent sexually transmitted infection (STI) in 20 to 34% of cases. Recurrence PID increase the risk of infertility and chronic pelvic pain (LE2). Follow-up is recommended after PID (grade C). The rate of patients lost to follow-up is around 40%. Follow-up is improved by personalized text message reminders (grade B). Vaginal sampling for detection of N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, (and M. genitalium) by nucleic acid amplification techniques is recommended 3 to 6 months after treatment of PID associated with STI to rule out possible reinfections (grade C). The use of condoms after PID associated with STI is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrences (grade C). The systematic use of contraceptive pills after PID is not recommended to prevent subsequent infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Vaginal sampling for microbiological diagnosis is recommended before the insertion of an intrauterine device (grade B). The risk of ectopic pregnancy is high in these women and must be kept in mind. CONCLUSION: Patient counselling and microbiological testing after PID decrease the risk of STI and thus the recurrence of PID."
0,Time to resolution of genital symptoms for uncomplicated gonorrhoea: a prospective cohort study,10.1136/sextrans-2020-054626,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the time to resolution of symptoms (TTR) following treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea and to identify factors associated with TTR in a cohort of sexual health clinic attendees. METHODS: Participants were recruited from 14 clinics across England into the 'Gentamicin for the Treatment of Gonorrhoea (GToG)' trial between October 2014 and November 2016. We analysed demographic, behavioural and clinical data in a subset of the GToG study cohort presenting with genital discharge and/or dysuria, who subsequently experienced microbiological clearance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae 2 weeks after treatment. Testing for gonorrhoea was performed using a nucleic acid amplification test. The results were expressed as median TTR (IQR) and HRs with 95% CIs for resolution of symptoms. RESULTS: 216 participants (89% male) with a mean age of 32 years reported genital discharge (204/216 (94%)) or dysuria (173/216 (80%)) at their baseline visit. Symptom resolution occurred in 202/216 (94%) at the 2-week follow-up appointment. The median TTR was 2 days (IQR 1-3 days). 50/216 (23%) patients presented with gonorrhoea-chlamydia coinfection at their baseline attendance and in this group symptom resolution was slower (3 days for gonorrhoea-chlamydia coinfection compared with 2 days for gonorrhoea only, HR 0.68 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95)). TTR was also longer in women (4 days for females compared with 2 days for males, HR 0.47 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.77)). CONCLUSIONS: The time to resolution of genital symptoms following effective treatment of gonorrhoea is variable, but 90% of patients report symptom resolution within 1 week. Concurrent chlamydia infection and being female were associated with prolonged TTR."
0,Factors associated with time to presentation for individuals with symptomatic uncomplicated genital gonorrhoea: a cross sectional cohort study of GToG trial participants,10.1136/sextrans-2019-054253,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the variation in the time from onset of symptoms to clinical presentation (time to presentation [TTP]) in a cohort of sexual health attendees with symptomatic uncomplicated genital gonorrhoea and to identify factors associated with TTP. METHODS: Participants were recruited from 14 clinics across England into the 'Gentamicin for the Treatment of Gonorrhoea (GToG)' trial between October 2014 and November 2016. Multivariable analysis was performed using prospectively collected demographic, behavioural and clinical data in a subset of the GToG study cohort presenting with genital discharge and/or dysuria who tested positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae using a nucleic acid amplification test. The results were expressed as geometric mean ratios (GMR) with 95% CI for time to presentation after onset of symptoms. RESULTS: 316 participants (269 men and 47 women) with a median age of 27.6 years (IQR 23.0-34.8) were included. 194 (61%) were Caucasian, 29 (9%) Black African, 27 (9%) Asian and 66 (21%) of other ethnicities. Median TTP was 3 days for men (IQR 2-7) and 14 days for women (IQR 7-21). Participants reported genital discharge (297/316 [94%]), dysuria (251/316 [79%]), both genital discharge and dysuria (232/316 [73%]) and other concurrent symptoms 76/316 (24%) (e.g., rectal bleeding or genital itching). 45/316 (14%) participants reported sexual contact while symptomatic, of whom TTP was more than 7 days in 32/45 (71%). A longer TTP was associated with gender (female cf. male, GMR 2.34 [1.67 to 3.26]), no prior history of gonorrhoea (GMR 1.46 [1.15 to 1.86]), 'regular' or 'ex-regular' sexual relationship (regular cf. one off GMR 1.35 [1.05 to 1.72]); ex-regular cf. one off GMR 1.88 [1.12 to 3.14]), and being heterosexual (GMR 1.69 [1.31 to 2.19]). CONCLUSION: Specific demographic and behavioural factors are associated with a longer TTP in individuals with symptomatic genital gonorrhoea. Detailed knowledge of these factors can be used to prioritise and optimise gonorrhoea management and prevention."
1,An early evaluation of clinical and economic costs and benefits of implementing point of care NAAT tests for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea in genitourinary medicine clinics in England,10.1136/sextrans-2013-051147,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the costs and benefits of clinical pathways incorporating a point of care (POC) nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for chlamydia and gonorrhoea in genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics compared with standard off-site laboratory testing. METHOD: We simulated 1.2 million GUM clinic attendees in England. A simulation in Microsoft Excel was developed to compare existing standard pathways of management for chlamydia and gonorrhoea with a POC NAAT. We conducted scenario analyses to evaluate the robustness of the model findings. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Secondary outcomes included the number of inappropriate treatments, complications and transmissions averted. RESULTS: The baseline cost of using the point of POC NAAT was £103.9 million compared with £115.6 million for standard care. The POC NAAT was also associated with a small increase of 46 quality adjusted life years, making the new test both more effective and cheaper. Over 95 000 inappropriate treatments might be avoided by using a POC NAAT. Patients receive diagnosis and treatment on the same day as testing, which may also prevent 189 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease and 17 561 onward transmissions annually. DISCUSSION: Replacing standard laboratory tests for chlamydia and gonorrhoea with a POC test could be cost saving and patients would benefit from more accurate diagnosis and less unnecessary treatment. Overtreatment currently accounts for about a tenth of the reported treatments for chlamydia and gonorrhoea and POC NAATs would effectively eliminate the need for presumptive treatment."
0,"Who tests whom? A comprehensive overview of Chlamydia trachomatis test practices in a Dutch region among different STI care providers for urogenital, anorectal and oropharyngeal sites in young people: a cross-sectional study",10.1136/sextrans-2015-052065,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) diagnostic test practices of different sexually transmitted infection (STI) care providers in 16-29 year olds from one defined geographic Dutch region (280,000 inhabitants). Both number and proportion of positive CT tests (ie, test positivity) were assessed, and factors associated with these outcomes. METHODS: Data on laboratory testing and diagnosis of urogenital, anorectal and oropharyngeal CT between 2006 and 2010 were retrieved from general practitioners (GPs), gynaecologists, an STI clinic and a population-based chlamydia screening programme. Multivariable regression analyses explored associations between age, sex, test year, socio-economic status (SES) and STI care provider and the outcomes being the number of tests and test positivity. RESULTS: Overall, 22,831 tests were performed (1868 positive; 8.2%). Extragenital (ie, anorectal and oropharyngeal) tests accounted for 4% of all tests (7.5% positive) and were almost exclusively (99%) performed by the STI clinic. STI clinics tested most men (37.2% of all tested men), whereas GPs tested most women (29.9% of all tested women). GPs and STI clinics accounted for 73.3% (1326/1808) of urogenital CT diagnoses. In women, the number of tests increased with age, whereas test positivity decreased for all STI care providers. Lower SES was associated with higher test positivity in GP and gynaecology patients. CONCLUSIONS: STI clinics performed most CT tests in men, whereas GPs performed most CT tests in women. GPs and STI clinics accounted for the majority of positives. Extragenital CT testing is rarely performed outside the STI clinic and needs to be promoted, especially in men who have sex with men."
0,An outbreak of high-level azithromycin resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in England,10.1136/sextrans-2015-052312,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate a potential outbreak of high-level azithromycin resistant (HL-AziR) gonococcal infections diagnosed in eight patients attending a sexual health clinic in Leeds, North England, between November 2014 and March 2015. METHODS: Eight cases of infection with gonococci exhibiting azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ≥256 mg/L were identified from patients in Leeds as part of the routine service provided by the Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Unit. All patient records were reviewed to collate epidemiological and clinical information including evaluation of patient management. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on seven gonococcal isolates to determine Neisseria gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence type (NG-MAST), WGS comparison and mutations in the 23S rRNA genes. RESULTS: All patients were heterosexual (five male, three female) from a range of ethnic backgrounds and from the Leeds area. Three patients were linked by partner notification. All patients were infected at genital sites and two women had pharyngeal infection also. Six patients received the recommended first-line therapy for uncomplicated gonorrhoea, one was treated for pelvic inflammatory disease and one received spectinomycin followed later by ciprofloxacin. Test of cure was achieved in seven patients and confirmed successful eradication. All seven isolates sequenced were identical by NG-MAST and WGS comparison, and contained an A2143G mutation in all four 23S rRNA alleles. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological and microbiological investigations confirm that an outbreak of a gonococcal strain showing HL-AziR is ongoing in the North of England. Every effort should be made to identify and curtail dissemination of this strain as it presents a significant threat to the current recommended front-line dual therapy."
0,"Modelling-based evaluation of the costs, benefits and cost-effectiveness of multipathogen point-of-care tests for sexually transmitted infections in symptomatic genitourinary medicine clinic attendees",10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020394,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the costs, benefits and cost-effectiveness of three multipathogen point-of-care (POC) testing strategies for detecting common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared with standard laboratory testing. DESIGN: Modelling study. SETTING: Genitourinary medicine (GUM) services in England. POPULATION: A hypothetical cohort of 965 988 people, representing the annual number attending GUM services symptomatic of lower genitourinary tract infection. INTERVENTIONS: The decision tree model considered costs and reimbursement to GUM services associated with diagnosing and managing STIs. Three strategies using hypothetical point-of-care tests (POCTs) were compared with standard care (SC) using laboratory-based testing. The strategies were: A) dual POCT for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG); B) triplex POCT for CT-NG and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG); C) quadruplex POCT for CT-NG-MG and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). Data came from published literature and unpublished estimates. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were total costs and benefits (quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) for each strategy (2016 GB, £) and associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between each of the POC strategies and SC. Secondary outcomes were inappropriate treatment of STIs, onward STI transmission, pelvic inflammatory disease in women, time to cure and total attendances. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, POC strategy C, a quadruplex POCT, was the most cost-effective relative to the other strategies, with an ICER of £36 585 per QALY gained compared with SC when using microcosting, and cost-savings of £26 451 382 when using tariff costing. POC strategy C also generated the most benefits, with 240 467 fewer clinic attendances, 808 fewer onward STI transmissions and 235 135 averted inappropriate treatments compared with SC. CONCLUSIONS: Many benefits can be achieved by using multipathogen POCTs to improve STI diagnosis and management. Further evidence is needed on the underlying prevalence of STIs and SC delivery in the UK to reduce uncertainty in economic analyses."
0,Evaluation of an enzymatic Chlamydia trachomatis point-of-care rapid assay in Rwanda: the BioChekSwab Rapid Test,10.1136/sextrans-2015-052202,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the performance of an enzymatic point-of-care rapid test for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) (the BioChekSwab CT Rapid Test, EnZtek Diagnostics, Rio Vista, California, USA), which detects CT's Peptidase 123CBV enzyme and provides a result 15 min after specimen collection. METHODS: Two endocervical swabs, including one BioChekSwab, per person were obtained from 137 women who participated in a reproductive health study in Rwanda. The BioChekSwab was processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A substrate was squirted over the swab by the study physician immediately after collection, and another reagent was released over the swab tip at arrival in the laboratory. The test was considered positive if a blue colour developed within 2 min. The other regular flocked endocervical swab was processed at the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), Belgium, using a testing algorithm: Abbott RealTime CT/Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) assay with the confirmation of positive results by an in-house real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of the 137 women, nine were CT positive by the testing algorithm. All nine positive results were missed by the BioChekSwab assay and four false-positive results were obtained. The sensitivity was therefore 0% (95% CI 0% to 33.6%) and the specificity was 96.9% (95% CI 92.2% to 99.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The BioChekSwab Rapid Test, although ISO13485 certified and Conformitée Européenne (CE) labelled, lacked any sensitivity in our setting."
0,Sexual exposure and sexual behaviour in the interval between gonorrhoea treatment and test of cure: a cross-sectional cohort study,10.1136/sextrans-2021-055029,"OBJECTIVES: We explored sexual contact in the interval between the treatment for gonorrhoea and attending for a test of cure (ToC) and identified factors associated with sexual contact in this period. METHODS: Multivariable analysis of demographic, behavioural and clinical data with self-reported sexual contact prior to attending for a gonorrhoea ToC evaluation among participants recruited into the 'Gentamicin for the Treatment of Gonorrhoea' trial in England, between October 2014 and November 2016. Associations with sexual contact were expressed as prevalence ratios (PR) and their corresponding 95% CI. RESULTS: The median time to ToC was 15 days (interquartile range 14-20 days). 197/540 (37%) participants reported sexual contact in the time between treatment and ToC. Of these, 173/197 (88%) participants reported inconsistent condom use, including with previous partners (133/197 (68%)). A history of gonorrhoea (adjusted PR (aPR) 1.32 (1.03 to 1.69)) or syphilis (aPR 1.19 (1.08 to 1.32)), being in regular (aPR 1.71 (1.41 to 2.09)) sexual relationships, high number of partners in the last 3 months (aPR 1.77 (1.25 to 2.51))-'more than 5 partners' vs '0 to 1 partner', and attending for a ToC more than 14 days after treatment (aPR 1.40 (1.08 to 1. 81)) were associated with reporting sexual contact before the ToC appointment. However, age (aPR (1.00 (0.99 to 1.01)) and presenting with specific symptoms at baseline (aPR 1.17 (0.95 to 1.44)) were not associated with sexual contact by the ToC attendance. CONCLUSION: Sexual activity after receiving treatment for gonorrhoea and prior to a ToC evaluation was common. This was associated with previous infection history and specific behavioural characteristics. Knowledge of these factors can help guide safe sex counselling at the time of treatment."
0,"Prevalence and correlates of cervical abnormalities among female sex workers in Tijuana, Mexico",10.1177/0956462419841464,"OBJECTIVES:: In Tijuana, Mexico, sex work is regulated by the municipal health department and includes regular testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for registered female sex workers (FSWs). However, Pap testing is missing from current sexual health assessments. We aimed to answer the following research questions: 1.) What is the prevalence of cervical abnormalities among a sample of FSWs in Tijuana, Mexico? 2.) What are the correlates of cervical abnormalities among a sample of FSWs in Tijuana, Mexico? STUDY DESIGN:: From 2013-2014, a cohort of 300 FSWs in Tijuana, Mexico were recruited using modified time-location sampling. Participants were given Pap, HIV, and STI tests. RESULTS:: The prevalence of an abnormal Pap was 11.7% (35/300). FSWs ever registered with municipal health services were less likely to have an abnormal Pap result (4.8% vs 14.4%, p=0.03), were more likely to report a previous Pap test (88.1% vs 70.4%, p=.001), and were more likely to report a sexual health checkup in the last year (60.7% vs 37.0%, p<0.001) than those who had never been registered. CONCLUSIONS:: FSWs remain at risk for cervical abnormalities, including those registered with the municipality."

Its rapid diagnosis and treatment can avoid long-term complications, such as extra-uterine pregnancy and infertility. We report a case of FHC in a 16-year-old female caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. We discuss the diagnosis, which can be easier with noninvasive methods including CT and laboratory tests."
1,Risk of pelvic inflammatory disease following Chlamydia trachomatis infection: analysis of prospective studies with a multistate model,10.1093/aje/kws583,"Our objective in this study was to estimate the probability that a Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection will cause an episode of clinical pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and the reduction in such episodes among women with CT that could be achieved by annual screening. We reappraised evidence from randomized controlled trials of screening and controlled observational studies that followed untreated CT-infected and -uninfected women to measure the development of PID. Data from these studies were synthesized using a continuous-time Markov model which takes into account the competing risk of spontaneous clearance of CT. Using a 2-step piecewise homogenous Markov model that accounts for the distinction between prevalent and incident infections, we investigated the possibility that the rate of PID due to CT is greater during the period immediately following infection. The available data were compatible with both the homogenous and piecewise homogenous models. Given a homogenous model, the probability that a CT episode will cause clinical PID was 0.16 (95% credible interval (CrI): 0.06, 0.25), and annual screening would prevent 61% (95% CrI: 55, 67) of CT-related PID in women who became infected with CT. Assuming a piecewise homogenous model with a higher rate during the first 60 days, corresponding results were 0.16 (95% CrI: 0.07, 0.26) and 55% (95% CrI: 32, 72), respectively."
0,Diagnostic challenge of chlamydial Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome and cervicitis complicated by appendicitis: Case report,10.1002/jgf2.446,"Our patient had appendicitis complicated by Chlamydia trachomatis-induced Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome and cervicitis. Differential diagnosis was challenging. A 22-year-old Japanese woman was febrile and presented with vomiting and subsequent abdominal pain. She had unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners. She had high Alvarado score and lack of cervical motion pain, despite cervical inflammation. Noncontrast CT showed enlarged appendix. Laparoscopic appendectomy revealed acute suppurative appendicitis and perihepatic adhesion. Cervical PCR assay was positive for C. trachomatis. She remained febrile but defervesced after azithromycin therapy. Clinicians should confirm whether females with abdominal pain are sexually active in view of screening for C. trachomatis."
0,An endometrial organoid model of interactions between Chlamydia and epithelial and immune cells,10.1242/jcs.252403,"Our understanding of how the obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis reprograms the function of infected cells in the upper genital tract is largely based on observations made in cell culture with transformed epithelial cell lines. Here, we describe a primary organoid system derived from endometrial tissue to recapitulate epithelial cell diversity, polarity and ensuing responses to Chlamydia infection. Using high-resolution and time-lapse microscopy, we catalog the infection process in organoids from invasion to egress, including the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and positioning of intracellular organelles. We show this model is amenable to screening C. trachomatis mutants for defects in the fusion of pathogenic vacuoles, the recruitment of intracellular organelles and inhibition of cell death. Moreover, we reconstructed a primary immune cell response by co-culturing infected organoids with neutrophils, and determined that effectors like CPAF (also known as CT858) and TepP (also known as CT875) limit the recruitment of neutrophils to infected organoids. Collectively, our model can be applied to study the cell biology of Chlamydia infections in three-dimensional structures that better reflect the diversity of cell types and polarity encountered by Chlamydia in their animal hosts."
0,Evaluation of the Efficacy of a New Commercially Available Inactivated Vaccine Against Ovine Enzootic Abortion,10.3389/fvets.2020.00593,"Ovine enzootic abortion (OEA), caused by Chlamydia abortus, is an economically important disease in many countries. Inactivated vaccines have been used for many years as they induce immunity in sheep, although outbreaks of abortions have been described in vaccinated flocks. In addition, there is a commercially available live attenuated vaccine that provides good protective results. Recently however, reports question the attenuation of this vaccine and associate it with the appearance of outbreaks of OEA in vaccinated flocks. In the present study, a recently commercialized inactivated vaccine (INMEVA®; Laboratorios Hipra S.A., Amer, Spain) has been evaluated using mouse and sheep experimental models. In the mouse models (non-pregnant and pregnant models), the efficacy of INMEVA vaccine has been compared to an unvaccinated control group and to an experimental inactivated vaccine considered as a positive protection control (UMU vaccine). In the non- pregnant model, the UMU vaccine was more effective than the INMEVA vaccine regarding the impact on body weight or the presence of C. abortus in the liver, but both vaccinated groups (UMU and INMEVA) had significantly lower C. abortus in the liver compared to the control group. In the pregnant model in terms of reproductive failures, pups per mouse or the presence of C. abortus in the liver or uterus, no significant differences were found between both vaccines, inducing protection compared to the control group. In the ovine pregnant model, where INMEVA vaccine was compared only to an unvaccinated group, the results indicate that this new commercial vaccine is safe and provides a suitable level of protection against an experimental challenge with C. abortus. A 75% reduction in reproductive disorders, 55% reduction in animals with C. abortus shedding on day of parturition/abortion, and a significant reduction of the average amount of chlamydial shedding from parturition/abortion over the next 21 days was observed, in relation to the infected control group. The results suggest that this vaccine is adequate for the control and prevention of OEA; however, future studies are necessary to elucidate the type of protective immune response that it induces."

The 'pelvic inflammatory disease' (PID) describes an ascending inflammation of the upper female genital tract, beginning with a local cervicitis and proceeding to endometritis and adnexitis. It is a common clinical picture with rising numbers in recent years, and it occurs both in gynaecological and general practice. The symptoms are often unspecific, discrete or althogehter lacking. In order to reduce long-term risks of chronic pelvic pain, sterility and/or ectopic pregnancies, rapid diagnosis followed by immediate therapy and a good interdisciplinary cooperation are necessary. Screening programs for chlamydia and gonococcus as the most common pathogens of PID have not yet been implemented in Switzerland so far."
1,"Pelvic inflammatory disease among female recruit trainees, active component, U.S. Armed Forces, 2002-2012",,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a bacterial infection causing an inflammatory reaction in the upper genital tract. It can be treated with antibiotics, but since it is often asymptomatic, women often delay seeking health care, which may result in long-term sequelae such as infertility. Among 161,501 female recruits who began basic training between January 2002 and December 2011, 1,750 (1.1%) met the surveillance case definition for PID during the 12 months following completion of their basic military training. The overall incidence rate (11.2 per 1,000 person-years) showed a stable trend during the surveillance period, with the exception of a decline for females accessed in 2011. The unadjusted rates were higher among women who were not screened for chlamydia during basic training. Compared to their respective counterparts, rates were higher in service women aged 17-20, of black, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, married, in the Army, and who had a chlamydia diagnosis after basic training. The lowest rates were among women 25 years and older, other race/ethnicity, and in the Coast Guard. The findings in this report may warrant further evaluation of the long-term impact of chlamydia screening programs for recruit trainees on PID and PID-related sequelae among service women."
1,"Prevalence of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease in Sexually Experienced Women of Reproductive Age - United States, 2013-2014",10.15585/mmwr.mm6603a3,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a clinical syndrome of the female reproductive tract characterized by inflammation of the endometrium, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum (1). PID occurs when microorganisms ascend from the vagina or cervix to the fallopian tubes and other upper genital tract structures (1). PID can result from untreated bacterial infections, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, and can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain (1). Because there is no single diagnostic test for PID, clinicians rely on nonspecific signs and symptoms for diagnosis. The purpose of these analyses was to assess the burden of self-reported PID in a nationally representative sample using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 cycle. Starting in 2013, NHANES female participants aged 18-44 years were asked about a lifetime history of PID diagnosis. Based on these data, the estimated prevalence of self-reported lifetime PID was 4.4% in sexually experienced women of reproductive age (18-44 years). The prevalence of self-reported lifetime PID was highest in women at increased risk, such as women reporting a previous sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis. Stratified by race/ethnicity and having a previous STI diagnosis, non-Hispanic black (black) and non-Hispanic white (white) women reporting a previous STI diagnosis had nearly equal self-reported lifetime PID prevalence (10.0% versus 10.3%). However, the lifetime prevalence of PID among black women was 2.2 times that among white women if no previous STI was diagnosed (6.0% versus 2.7%). These findings suggest that PID is prevalent and associated with previous STI diagnoses; therefore, it is important for clinicians to screen female patients for chlamydia and gonorrhea to reduce the incidence of PID."
1,Etiology and Diagnosis of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: Looking Beyond Gonorrhea and Chlamydia,10.1093/infdis/jiab067,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a clinical syndrome that has been associated with a wide range of potential causal pathogens. Three broad groups of organisms have been isolated from the genital tract of people with PID: sexually transmitted organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Trichomonas vaginalis; bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated species and genera such as Atopobium vaginae, Sneathia, and Megasphaera; and genera and species usually associated with the gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts such as Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, or Haemophilus influenza. Although PID is often considered to be synonymous with gonorrhea or chlamydia, these pathogens are found in only one quarter to one third of people with PID, suggesting that broader screening and diagnostic and treatment strategies need to be considered to reduce the burden of PID and its associated sequelae."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European CDC report Chlamydia trachomatis as the most common sexually transmitted infection and one of the main etiological agents causing PID. C. trachomatis' and PID's high prevalence may be attributed to multiple factors including high-risk sexual behaviors, sensitive laboratory diagnostics (polymerase chain reaction), and the introduction of chlamydia screening programs. The pathogenesis of C. trachomatis infection is complex with recent data highlighting the role of toll-like receptor 2 and four in the mediation of the inflammatory cascade. The authors review the etiology of the disease, explore its pathogenesis, and discuss a variety of strategies that may be implemented to reduce the prevalence of C. trachomatis including: (a) behavioral risk reduction, (b) effective screening of asymptomatic females, (c) targeted male screening, (d) implementation of a sensitive, rapid, self-administered point-of-care testing, and (e) development of an effective vaccine."
0,Management of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease in Clinical Practice.,10.2147/TCRM.S350750,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a common reproductive health disorder among women of reproductive age. The treatment of PID has slowly evolved, reflecting  changing antibiotic susceptibility and advancements in therapeutics and research;  however, it has been largely unchanged over the last several decades. The most  recent treatment recommendations consider the severity of infection, clinical  presentation, and the polymicrobial nature of the disease. In addition, the role  of novel organisms like Mycoplasma genitalium in PID is of emerging significance.  PID treatment guidance offers oral and parenteral treatment options based on the  patient's clinical status; however, deviations from the published guidelines are  a general concern. Point of care (POC) testing for precision care, provision of  adherence support, optimizing self-management and prevention strategies, and  other alternative or synergistic approaches that maximize treatment outcomes will  be instrumental for addressing the current challenges in PID diagnosis and  management."
1,"Incidence and sequelae of acute pelvic inflammatory disease among active component females, U.S. Armed Forces, 1996-2016",,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a consequence of untreated or inadequately treated sexually transmitted infections that can itself lead to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Annual screening for asymptomatic chlamydia and gonorrhea infection helps reduce the incidence of acute PID. In the military, routine versus risk-based individual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea began in some services in 2001, with full implementation across the services by 2005. From 1996 through 2016, rates of acute PID among active component women started to decline in the mid-2000s, consistent with national trends and coinciding with implementation of routine annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screening. Of active component women diagnosed with acute PID from 1996 through 2012, 6.1% were subsequently diagnosed with infertility or ectopic pregnancy, with higher proportions found among women in the Army and those aged 25-34 years. The overall decrease in the rates of acute PID in the military is consistent with national trends, and continued screening for asymptomatic chlamydia and gonorrhea infections should result in a continuing decline in the incidence of acute PID."

While limited data are available from low- and middle-income countries, national databases from the United States and Europe suggest that PID incidence may be decreasing but the rate of decrease may differ by the etiologic cause. Recent studies of women with PID have reported that fewer than half of women receiving a diagnosis of PID have gonococcal or chlamydial infection, while Mycoplasma genitalium, respiratory pathogens, and the constellation of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis may account for a substantial fraction of PID cases. The clinical diagnosis of PID is nonspecific, creating an urgent need to develop noninvasive tests to diagnose PID. Advances in serologic testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae could advance epidemiologic studies, while the development of vaccines against these sexually transmitted pathogens could affect incident PID and associated morbidity."

It is often a sexually transmitted disease but other etiologic routes are also noted. A variety of risk factors have been identified including adolescence, young adulthood, adolescent cervical ectropion, multiple sexual partners, immature immune system, history of previous PID, risky contraceptive practices and others. An early diagnosis and prompt treatment are necessary to reduce risks of PID complications such as chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Current management principles of PID are also reviewed. It is important for clinicians to screen sexually active females for common sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis and provide safer sex education to their adolescent and young adult patients. Clinicians should provide comprehensive management to persons with PID and utilize established guidelines such as those from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."
1,"Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention",,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract occurring predominantly in sexually active young women. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes; however, other cervical, enteric, bacterial vaginosis-associated, and respiratory pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may be involved. PID can be acute, chronic, or subclinical and is often underdiagnosed. Untreated PID can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and intra-abdominal infections. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical suspicion, and empiric treatment is recommended in sexually active young women or women at risk for sexually transmitted infections who have unexplained lower abdominal or pelvic pain and cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on examination. Mild to moderate disease can be treated in an outpatient setting with a single intramuscular injection of a recommended cephalosporin followed by oral doxycycline for 14 days. Additionally, metronidazole is recommended for 14 days in the setting of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or recent uterine instrumentation. Hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics is recommended in patients who are pregnant or severely ill, in whom outpatient treatment has failed, those with tubo-ovarian abscess, or if surgical emergencies cannot be excluded. Treatment does not change in patients with intrauterine devices or those with HIV. Sex partner treatment is recommended; expedited partner treatment is recommended where legal. Prevention of PID includes screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in all women younger than 25 years and those who are at risk or pregnant, plus intensive behavioral counseling for all adolescents and adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections."

Although a definitive diagnosis of PID is made by laparoscopic visualization of inflamed, purulent fallopian tubes, PID is generally a clinical diagnosis and thus represents a diagnostic challenge. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment algorithms advise a high index of suspicion for PID in any woman of reproductive age with pelvic or abdominal pain. Antibiotic therapy should be started early, and given for an adequate period of time to reduce the risk of complications. Coverage for anaerobic organisms should be considered in most cases."
1,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is defined as an inflammation of the upper genital tract due to an infection in women. The disease affects the uterus, fallopian tubes, and/or ovaries. It is typically an ascending infection, spreading from the lower genital tract. The majority of cases of PID are related to a sexually transmitted infection. The diagnosis of PID is primarily clinical and should be suspected in female patients with lower abdominal or pelvic pain and genital tract tenderness. During the patient’s evaluation, other etiologies of pain, including ectopic pregnancy, should be considered and ruled out. PID is treated with antibiotics to cover the primary pathogens, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Short-term complications include tubo-ovarian or pelvic abscess. Long-term complications include ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Early diagnosis and treatment can potentially prevent complications."

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of PID that requires initial intravenous therapy, we conducted a multicenter, unblinded, non-comparative phase 3 trial. Intravenous azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for 1 or 2 days followed by oral azithromycin (250 mg once daily) to complete a total of 7 days treatment was administered to 60 Japanese women with acute PID. The clinical and bacteriological responses were assessed at the end of treatment, and on Days 15 and 29. The most commonly detected baseline causative pathogens were C. trachomatis (12 strains), Prevotella bivia (10 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (7 strains), N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6 strains each). The clinical success rate on Day 15 was 94.1% (48/51 subjects including perihepatitis). The clinical efficacy and bacterial eradication rates against C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae (including 2 quinolone-resistant strains) were both 100%. Common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea, injection site pain, and nausea. All adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Azithromycin intravenous-to-oral switch therapy demonstrated excellent clinical and bacteriological effects for PID caused by various etiologic agents including quinolone-resistant strains and strains with low susceptibility to azithromycin at in vitro testing. The therapy was well tolerated in the treatment of PID in Japanese women. REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00871494."
1,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis: Immune Evasion Mechanisms and Pathogenic Disease Pathways,10.1093/infdis/jiab031,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) results from ascension of sexually transmitted pathogens from the lower genital tract to the uterus and/or fallopian tubes in women, with potential spread to neighboring pelvic organs. Patients may present acutely with lower abdominal or pelvic pain and pelvic organ tenderness. Many have subtle symptoms or are asymptomatic and present later with tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy, or chronic pelvic pain. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are the 2 most commonly recognized PID pathogens. Their ability to survive within host epithelial cells and neutrophils highlights a need for T-cell-mediated production of interferon γ in protection. Data indicate that for both pathogens, antibody can accelerate clearance by enhancing opsonophagocytosis and bacterial killing when interferon γ is present. A study of women with N. gonorrhoeae- and/or C. trachomatis-induced PID with histologic endometritis revealed activation of myeloid cell, cell death, and innate inflammatory pathways in conjunction with dampening of T-cell activation pathways. These findings are supported by multiple studies in mouse models of monoinfection with N. gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia spp. Both pathogens exert multiple mechanisms of immune evasion that benefit themselves and each other at the expense of the host. However, similarities in host immune mechanisms that defend against these 2 bacterial pathogens instill optimism for the prospects of a combined vaccine for prevention of PID and infections in both women and men."

1,Immune Responses to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Challenges and Opportunities With Respect to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,10.1093/infdis/jiaa766,"Pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility frequently develop after female genital tract infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but determining their etiology from among various possibilities presents difficulties. Exploitation of serology to identify the causative agent is complicated by numerous factors, and no immunological test currently exists to determine unequivocally whether an individual currently is, or has been, infected with N. gonorrhoeae. The extensive antigenic variability of N. gonorrhoeae and its expression of antigens shared with other Neisseria species commonly carried in humans render problematic an assay that is specific for all gonococcal strains. However, novel conserved gonococcal antigens identified for potential vaccines may find additional application in diagnostic assays. N. gonorrhoeae also interferes with the adaptive immune response, and antibody responses to uncomplicated infection are usually weak. Elucidating the mechanisms whereby N. gonorrhoeae manipulates the human immune system may lead to improved understanding of the pathogenesis of pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility."

Co-infection in the endocervical environment with other  microorganisms, such as Chlamydia trachomatis, may increase the risk of HPV  infection and neoplastic progression. While in some individuals, Chlamydia  trachomatis infection is resolved with the activation of Th1/IFN-γ-mediated  immune response, others develop a chronic infection marked by Th2-mediated immune  response, resulting in intracellular persistence of the bacterium and increasing  the risk of HPV infection. This work aimed to quantify cytokines of the  Th1/Th2/Th17 profile in exfoliated cervix cells (ECC) and peripheral blood (PB)  of patients positive for Chlamydia trachomatis DNA, patients positive for  Papillomavirus DNA, and healthy patients. Cytokine levels were quantified by flow  cytometry in ECC and PB samples from patients positive for C. trachomatis DNA (n  = 18), patients positive for HPV DNA (n = 30), and healthy patients (n = 17)  treated at the Hospital de Amor, Campo Grande-MS. After analysis, a higher  concentration of IL-17, IL-6, and IL-4 (p <0.05) in ECC; INF-γ and IL-10 (p  <0.05) in PB was found in samples from patients positive for C. trachomatis DNA  compared to samples from healthy patients. When comparing samples from patients  positive for HPV DNA, there was a higher concentration of cytokines IL-17, IL-10,  IL-6, and IL-4 (p <0.05) in ECC and IL-4 and IL-2 (p <0.05) in PB of patients  positive for C. trachomatis DNA. These results suggest that induction of Th2- and  Th17 mediated immune response occurs in patients positive for C. trachomatis DNA,  indicating chronic infection. Our results also demonstrate a high concentration  of pro-inflammatory cytokines in ECC of patients positive for C. trachomatis DNA."
0,"Chlamydial polymorphic membrane proteins: regulation, function and potential vaccine candidates",10.1080/21505594.2015.1111509,"Pmps (Polymorphic Membrane Proteins) are a group of membrane bound surface exposed chlamydial proteins that have been characterized as autotransporter adhesins and are important in the initial phase of chlamydial infection. These proteins all contain conserved GGA (I, L, V) and FxxN tetrapeptide motifs in the N-terminal portion of each protein. All chlamydial species express Pmps. Even in the chlamydia-related bacteria Waddlia chondrophila, a Pmp-like adhesin has been identified, demonstrating the importance of Pmps in Chlamydiales biology. Chlamydial species vary in the number of pmp genes and their differentially regulated expression during the infectious cycle or in response to stress. Studies have also demonstrated that Pmps are able to induce innate immune functional responses in infected cells, including production of IL-8, IL-6 and MCP-1, by activating the transcription factor NF-κB. Human serum studies have indicated that although anti-Pmp specific antibodies are produced in response to a chlamydial infection, the response is variable depending on the Pmp protein. In C. trachomatis, PmpB, PmpC, PmpD and PmpI were the proteins eliciting the strongest immune response among adolescents with and without pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In contrast, PmpA and PmpE elicited the weakest antibody response. Interestingly, there seems to be a gender bias for Pmp recognition with a stronger anti-Pmp reactivity in male patients. Furthermore, anti-PmpA antibodies might contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, at least among women with PID. In vitro studies indicated that dendritic cells infected with C. muridarum were able to present PmpG and PmpF on their MHC class II receptors and T cells were able to recognize the MHC class-II bound peptides. In addition, vaccination with PmpEFGH and Major Outer Membrane Protein (MOMP) significantly protected mice against a genital tract C. muridarum infection, suggesting that Pmps may be an important component of a multi-subunit chlamydial vaccine. Thus, Pmps might be important not only for the pathogenesis of chlamydial infection, but also as potential candidate vaccine proteins."
0,Pneumoperitoneum secondary to tubo-ovarian abscess: A case report,10.1016/j.crwh.2020.e00181,"Pneumoperitoneum seen on an X-ray or computed tomography (CT) image points to a diagnosis of ruptured viscus and immediate surgery is warranted. A case of tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) presenting with pneumoperitoneum is unusual. Very few cases have been reported where the pneumoperitoneum is caused by an abscess involving the adnexa. We present the case of a 17-year-old patient who presented with acute abdomen and raised inflammatory markers and had laparoscopy for suspected bowel perforation based on the finding of pneumoperitoneum on CT scan. Bowel perforation was ruled out and the findings were consistent with TOA. She had drainage of the abscess, subsequently received intravenous antibiotics and postoperatively recovered well. The pneumoperitoneum could have been due to coinfection with E. coli, as the patient had had a urinary tract infection due to E. coli three weeks before presentation, or slow leakage of the TOA. In conclusion, gas under the diaphragm can be related to non-bowel-related gynaecological pathology, but it vital to rule out sinister causes."
0,Return on investment: a fuller assessment of the benefits and cost savings of the US publicly funded family planning program,10.1111/1468-0009.12080,"Policy Points: The US publicly supported family planning effort serves millions of women and men each year, and this analysis provides new estimates of its positive impact on a wide range of health outcomes and its net savings to the government. The public investment in family planning programs and providers not only helps women and couples avoid unintended pregnancy and abortion, but also helps many thousands avoid cervical cancer, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, infertility, and preterm and low birth weight births. This investment resulted in net government savings of $13.6 billion in 2010, or $7.09 for every public dollar spent. CONTEXT: Each year the United States' publicly supported family planning program serves millions of low-income women. Although the health impact and public-sector savings associated with this program's services extend well beyond preventing unintended pregnancy, they never have been fully quantified. METHODS: Drawing on an array of survey data and published parameters, we estimated the direct national-level and state-level health benefits that accrued from providing contraceptives, tests for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), Pap tests and tests for human papillomavirus (HPV), and HPV vaccinations at publicly supported family planning settings in 2010. We estimated the public cost savings attributable to these services and compared those with the cost of publicly funded family planning services in 2010 to find the net public-sector savings. We adjusted our estimates of the cost savings for unplanned births to exclude some mistimed births that would remain publicly funded if they had occurred later and to include the medical costs for births through age 5 of the child. FINDINGS: In 2010, care provided during publicly supported family planning visits averted an estimated 2.2 million unintended pregnancies, including 287,500 closely spaced and 164,190 preterm or low birth weight (LBW) births, 99,100 cases of chlamydia, 16,240 cases of gonorrhea, 410 cases of HIV, and 13,170 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease that would have led to 1,130 ectopic pregnancies and 2,210 cases of infertility. Pap and HPV tests and HPV vaccinations prevented an estimated 3,680 cases of cervical cancer and 2,110 cervical cancer deaths; HPV vaccination also prevented 9,000 cases of abnormal sequelae and precancerous lesions. Services provided at health centers supported by the Title X national family planning program accounted for more than half of these benefits. The gross public savings attributed to these services totaled approximately $15.8 billion-$15.7 billion from preventing unplanned births, $123 million from STI/HIV testing, and $23 million from Pap and HPV testing and vaccines. Subtracting $2.2 billion in program costs from gross savings resulted in net public-sector savings of $13.6 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Public expenditures for the US family planning program not only prevented unintended pregnancies but also reduced the incidence and impact of preterm and LBW births, STIs, infertility, and cervical cancer. This investment saved the government billions of public dollars, equivalent to an estimated taxpayer savings of $7.09 for every public dollar spent."

An observational study evaluating a risk prediction tool to identify persons with chlamydia in high-risk populations had low predictive ability and applicability. In 10 new studies of asymptomatic participants, nucleic acid amplification tests demonstrated sensitivity of 86% or greater and specificity of 97% or greater for diagnosing gonorrhea and chlamydia, regardless of specimen type or test., Studies of screening benefits and harms were lacking for men, pregnant women, adolescents, and subgroups. Only screening tests and methods cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for current clinical practice were included to determine diagnostic accuracy, excluding rectal, pharyngeal, and self-administered specimens obtained outside a clinical setting., Chlamydia screening in young women may reduce pelvic inflammatory disease. Nucleic acid amplification tests are accurate for diagnosing gonorrhea and chlamydia in asymptomatic persons using various types of specimens. Research is needed on the effectiveness of screening to reduce adverse health outcomes in specific population groups, effectiveness of different screening strategies, and adverse effects of screening to further inform practice guidelines."
0,"Primary Extranodal Marginal Cell Lymphoma, MALT Type, of the Endometrium Arising in a Patient With Rheumatoid Arthritis: Report of a Case",10.1097/PGP.0000000000000244,"Primary marginal zone B-cell MALT-type lymphomas of the uterine corpus are exceedingly rare entities, with only 6 cases reported in the literature to date. We present the additional case of a 70-yr-old white woman who underwent a laparoscopic total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for an asymptomatic ovarian cyst. At microscopic examination, endometrial samples showed a dense, nodular lymphocytic infiltrate, suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder. Morphology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular analysis supported the diagnosis of MALT-type lymphoma of the endometrium. Benign reactive conditions, such as endometritis and other small B-cell lymphomas were ruled out. Moreover, we investigated the pathogenesis of our case, focusing on Chlamydia trachomatis infection, chromosomal translocations affecting the NF-kB pathway, and discussing the role of autoimmunity in the development of MALT-type lymphomas."
0,"Anti-chlamydia IgG and IgA are insufficient to prevent endometrial chlamydia infection in women, and increased anti-chlamydia IgG is associated with enhanced risk for incident infection",10.1111/aji.13103,"PROBLEM: Chlamydia infections in women can ascend to the upper genital tract, and repeated infections are common, placing women at risk for sequelae. The protective role of anti-chlamydia antibodies to surface exposed antigens in ascending and incident infection is unclear. METHOD OF STUDY: A whole-bacterial ELISA was used to quantify chlamydia-specific IgG and IgA in serum and cervical secretions of 151 high-risk women followed longitudinally. Correlations were determined between antibody and cervical burden, and causal mediation analysis investigated the effect of antibody on ascension. We examined the relationship of antibody to incident infection using the marginal Cox model. RESULTS: Serum and cervical anti-chlamydia IgG and cervical IgA levels correlated inversely with cervical burden. While lower burden was associated with reduced ascension, causal mediation analysis revealed that the indirect effects of antibody mediated through reductions in bacterial burden were insufficient to prevent ascension. Analysis of women uninfected at enrollment revealed that serum and cervical anti-chlamydia IgG were associated with increased risk of incident infection; hazard ratio increased 3.6-fold (95% CI, 1.3-10.3), and 22.6-fold (95% CI, 3.1-165.2) with each unit of serum and cervical IgG, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although anti-chlamydia IgG and IgA correlated with reduced cervical chlamydia burden, they failed to prevent ascension and increased levels of anti-chlamydia IgG were associated with increased risk for incident infection."
0,Cervico-vaginal secretion cytokine profile: A non-invasive approach to study the endometrial receptivity in IVF cycles,10.1111/aji.13064,"PROBLEM: Cytokines have a significant role in the process of embryo implantation, trophoblast growth, and differentiation by modulating the immune and endocrine system. The aim of this study was to investigate the profile of a large set of cytokines in the cervico-vaginal washing of women undergoing IVF, to explore the association of these proteins with a good receptive endometrium. METHOD OF STUDY: A cohort of 155 women scheduled for IVF cycle was recruited. All patients were asymptomatic for genitourinary infections and had been screened for chlamydia, mycoplasma, and other bacterial infections. All IVF subjects were treated according to standard clinical and laboratory protocols. A panel of 48 immune factors was analyzed on cervico-vaginal washing, using magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassays (Bio-Plex, BIO-RAD Laboratories, Milano, Italy). RESULTS: A total of 99 patients reached embryo transfer, of which 31 had a clinical pregnancy. A pattern of four pro-inflammatory immune molecules, IL-12p40, IFN-a, MIF, and MCP3 (P < 0.001), was found significantly up-regulated in the cervico-vaginal fluid of women with clinical pregnancy. A significantly increased expression of IL-9, Groα , and SDF-1α (P < 0.05) was observed in the presence of endometriosis, while high levels of IL-13 and L-15 were associated with ovulatory infertility factor (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, we demonstrated that the expression of specific cytokines in the cervico-vaginal washing on the day of oocyte retrieval might have a positive correlation with the potential clinical pregnancy. Therefore, cervico-vaginal secretion cytokine profiling might be a new, non-invasive approach to study the endometrial receptivity in IVF management."
0,"Demographic, Behavioral, and Clinical Characteristics of Persons Seeking Care at Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinics - 14 Sites, STD Surveillance Network, United States, 2010-2018",10.15585/mmwr.ss7007a1,"PROBLEM: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a major cause of morbidity in the United States, with an estimated $15.9 billion in lifetime direct medical costs. Although the majority of STDs are diagnosed in the private sector, publicly funded STD clinics have an important role in providing comprehensive sexual health care services, including STD and HIV screening, for a broad range of patients. In certain cases, STD clinics often are the only source of sexual health care for patients, particularly among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). PERIOD COVERED: 2010-2018. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The STD Surveillance Network (SSuN) is an ongoing sentinel surveillance system for monitoring clinical information among patients attending STD clinics. SSuN is a collaboration of competitively selected state and city health departments that conduct facility-based sentinel surveillance in STD clinics. Information routinely collected through the course of patient encounters is obtained for all patients seeking care in the participating STD clinics. This information includes demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics (e.g., STD and HIV tests performed and STD and HIV diagnoses). This report presents 2010-2018 SSuN data from 14 STD clinics in five cities (Baltimore, Maryland; New York City, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; San Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington) to describe the patient populations seeking care in these STD clinics. Estimated numbers and percentages of patients receiving selected STD-related health services were calculated for each year by using an inverse variance weighted random-effects model, adjusting for heterogeneity among SSuN jurisdictions. Trends in receipt of selected STD-related health services were examined and included HIV screening after an acute STD diagnosis among persons not previously known to have HIV infection, annual chlamydia screening among adolescent and young females, and extragenital chlamydia and gonorrhea screening among MSM. RESULTS: During 2010-2018, the total number of annual visits made in the 14 participating STD clinics decreased 29.8% (from 145,728 to 102,275 visits), and the total number of unique patients examined in the clinics decreased 35.1% (from 94,281 to 61,172 patients). Decreases in the number of unique patients occurred both among men who have sex with women only (42.4%; from 37,842 in 2010 to 21,781 in 2018) and among females (51.4%; from 36,485 in 2010 to 17,721 in 2018). The decreases in the number of female patients were observed across all age groups, although they were more pronounced among females aged ≤24 years (66.4%; from 17,721 in 2010 to 5,962 in 2018). In contrast, the number of patients identified as MSM increased 44.0% (from 12,859 in 2010 to 18,512 in 2018), with the greatest increase among MSM aged ≥25 years (58.6%; from 9,918 in 2010 to 15,733 in 2018). Among visits during which an acute STD (defined as chlamydia, gonorrhea, or primary or secondary syphilis) was diagnosed, the percentage of visits during which an HIV test was performed within approximately 14 days of the STD diagnosis increased from 58.2% in 2010 to 70.2% in 2018. Among those patients tested, 1,672 HIV infections were identified, of which 84.0% were among MSM. Among females aged 15-24 years, the percentage screened for chlamydia in any calendar year increased from 88.6% in 2010 to 90.6% in 2018. However, because fewer females aged 15-24 years attended these clinics during the study period, the crude number of adolescent and young females tested for chlamydia decreased from 14,249 in 2010 to 4,507 in 2018. During 2010-2018, the percentage of females retested after their first positive chlamydia diagnosis during the same year ranged from 11.4% to 13.3%. During 2010-2018, the percentage of MSM tested for rectal chlamydia and rectal gonorrhea increased (from 54.7% to 57.8% and from 55.0% to 58.4%, respectively). During the same period, increases were noted in the percentage of MSM with diagnosed rectal chlamydia (from 15.5% in 2010 to 17.7% in 2018) and rectal gonorrhea (from 13.3% in 2010 to 17.1% in 2018). In contrast with pharyngeal chlamydia, pharyngeal gonorrhea screening was more common (from 69.5% in 2010 to 74.6% in 2018), and the percentage positive doubled during the study period (from 7.3% in 2010 to 14.8% in 2018). Pharyngeal chlamydia testing also increased (from 50.3% in 2010 to 72.9% in 2018), with concurrent decreases in positivity (from 4.2% in 2010 to 2.6% in 2018). INTERPRETATION: During 2010-2018, changes occurred in the demographic composition of patients attending STD clinics participating in SSuN. Understanding trends in the demographic profile of STD patients and services provided can help identify addressable gaps in STD control efforts and direct public health action. Overall, fewer females, especially those aged 15-24 years, accessed care in these STD clinics during the study period. Untreated STDs among adolescent and young females can have serious consequences, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Additional efforts to monitor where adolescent and young females seek care and to ensure they are receiving quality STD-related health services are needed, especially considering increases in reported cases of STDs among females. Increases in the number of MSM attending STD clinics present a unique opportunity to reach this population with STD and HIV prevention services. Although a large percentage of STD cases are diagnosed outside of STD clinics, publicly funded STD clinics are an important safety-net provider of STD-related health services and provide vital STD-related health services for patient populations at risk for the consequences of STDs and HIV infection. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: STD-related health services represent effective strategies for preventing STD and HIV transmission and acquisition or STD-related sequelae. Ensuring that all persons receive quality HIV and STD prevention and treatment services is vital for an effective public health approach to reducing STDs. STD clinics provide crucial safety-net services for preventing STD-related morbidity, including timely identification and treatment of curable STDs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Increases in the numbers of MSM attending STD clinics participating in SSuN provide additional opportunities for linking patients to high-impact HIV preventive services (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis), and the clinics are positioned to facilitate initiation or resumption of treatment among persons living with HIV."
0,Chlamydial infection enhances expression of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) and transcytosis of IgA,10.1111/aji.12611,"PROBLEM: The pIgR mediates transport of IgA into the lumen of mucosal tissues preventing pathogenic infection. Despite this, the expression of pIgR during chlamydial infections of the male and female reproductive tracts remains poorly understood. METHOD OF STUDY: The expression of pIgR in response to hormone cycling or over the course of chlamydial infection was determined in vitro and in vivo by Western blot or immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: PIgR was upregulated in response to Chlamydia spp. infection of human epithelia, in both male and female mouse reproductive tracts. PIgR expression was found to be highest during estrus in the cervicovaginal and uterine epithelia and lowest during diestrus or following hormonal synchronization with Depo-Provera. Chlamydial infection of mice mediates upregulation of pIgR and transcytosis of IgA into the lumen. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that chlamydial infection enhances IgA secretion and pIgR expression by epithelia in the lower reproductive tracts of females and males, and hormone synchronization downregulates pIgR expression and transcytosis of IgA prior to challenge."
0,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae Antimicrobial Susceptibility Surveillance - The Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project, 27 Sites, United States, 2014",10.15585/mmwr.ss6507a1,"PROBLEM/CONDITION: Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States; 350,062 gonorrhea cases were reported in 2014. Sexually transmitted infections caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae are a cause of pelvic inflammatory disease in women, which can lead to serious reproductive complications including tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. Prevention of sequelae and of transmission to sexual partners relies largely on prompt detection and effective antimicrobial treatment. However, treatment has been compromised by the absence of routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing in clinical care and evolution of antimicrobial resistance to the antibiotics used to treat gonorrhea. PERIOD COVERED: 2014. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) was established in 1986 as a sentinel surveillance system to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities of N. gonorrhoeae strains in the United States. Each month, N. gonorrhoeae isolates are collected from up to the first 25 men with gonococcal urethritis attending each of the participating sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics at 27 sites. The number of participating sites has varied over time (21-30 per year). Selected demographic and clinical data are abstracted from medical records. Isolates are tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using agar dilution at one of five regional laboratories. RESULTS: A total of 5,093 isolates were collected in 2014. Of these, 25.3% were resistant to tetracycline, 19.2% to ciprofloxacin, and 16.2% to penicillin (plasmid-based, chromosomal, or both). Reduced azithromycin susceptibility (Azi-RS) (defined as minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≥2.0 µg/mL) increased from 0.6% in 2013 to 2.5% in 2014. The increase occurred in all geographic regions, but was greatest in the Midwest, and among all categories of sex of sex partners (men who have sex with men [MSM], men who have sex with men and women [MSMW], and men who have sex with women [MSW]). No Azi-RS isolates exhibited reduced cefixime or ceftriaxone susceptibility (Cfx-RS and Cro-RS, respectively). The prevalence of Cfx-RS (MIC ≥0.25 µg/mL) increased from 0.1% in 2006 to 1.4% in both 2010 and 2011, decreased to 0.4% in 2013, and increased to 0.8% in 2014. Cro-RS (MIC ≥0.125 µg/mL) increased following a similar pattern but at lesser percentages (increased from 0.1% in 2008 to 0.4% in 2011 and decreased to 0.1% in 2013 and 2014). The percentage of isolates resistant to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, or all three antimicrobials, was greater in isolates from MSM than from MSW. INTERPRETATION: This is the first report to present comprehensive surveillance data from GISP and summarize gonococcal susceptibility over time, as well as underscore the history and public health implications of emerging cephalosporin resistance. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns vary by geographic region within the United States and by sex of sex partner. Because dual therapy with ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is the only recommended gonorrhea treatment, increases in azithromycin and cephalosporin MICs are cause for concern that resistance to these antimicrobial agents might be emerging. It is unclear whether increases in the percentage of isolates with Azi-RS mark the beginning of a trend. The percentage of isolates with elevated cefixime MICs increased during 2009-2010, then decreased during 2012-2013 after treatment recommendations were changed in 2010 to recommend dual therapy (with a cephalosporin and a second antibiotic) and a higher dosage of ceftriaxone. Subsequently, the treatment recommendations were changed again in 2012 to no longer recommend cefixime as part of first-line therapy (leaving ceftriaxone-based dual therapy as the only recommended therapy). Despite the MIC decrease (i.e., trend of improved cefixime susceptibility) during 2012-2013, the increase in the number of strains with Cfx-RS in 2014 underscores the potential threat of cephalosporin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria identifies prevention, rapid detection, and control of outbreaks of ceftriaxone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infection as a priority for U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance is conducted to guide development of treatment recommendations for effective therapy and prevention of complications from and transmission of gonorrhea. Federal agencies can use GISP data to develop national treatment recommendations and set research and prevention priorities. Local and state health departments can use GISP data to determine allocation of STD prevention services and resources, guide prevention planning, and communicate best treatment practices to health care providers. Continued surveillance, appropriate treatment, development of new antibiotics, and prevention of transmission remain the best strategies to reduce gonorrhea incidence and morbidity."
0,Diagnosis and treatment of bacterial prostatitis,10.15570/actaapa.2015.8,"Prostate inflammation is a common syndrome, especially in men under 50. It usually presents with voiding symptoms and pain in the genitourinary area, and sometimes as sexual dysfunction. Based on clinical and laboratory characteristics, prostatitis is classified as acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, chronic inflammatory and non-inflammatory prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. Bacterial prostatitis is most often caused by infection with uropathogens, mainly Gram-negative bacilli, but Gram-positive and atypical microorganisms have also been identified as causative organisms of chronic prostatitis. According to reports by several authors, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis are some of the most common pathogens, making chronic prostatitis a sexually transmitted disease. Diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis in particular can be challenging."
1,"Pelvic inflammatory disease in the adolescent: a poignant, perplexing, potentially preventable problem for patients and physicians",10.1097/MOP.0000000000000183,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review considers recent pelvic inflammatory disease literature. It remains a difficult condition to accurately diagnose and manage in the adolescent woman. Failure of accurate diagnosis and prompt management leads to complications, including chronic pelvic pain and infertility. RECENT FINDINGS: Annual chlamydia screening of sexually active adolescents is an important method for early identification of this common cause of this disorder. Youth with positive screens can be lost for treatment if effective follow-up plans are not in place in clinical practice. The intrauterine device is not a risk factor for this condition in adolescents and is a recommended contraceptive device in sexually active adolescent women. A variety of chlamydial antigens are being used to help differentiate lower genital infection from upper genital disorder. Clinicians are not following established protocols for its diagnosis and management. SUMMARY: Sequelae can be reduced in adolescent women if clinicians continue with regular chlamydia screening in sexually active adolescent women, have a low index of suspicion for pelvic inflammatory disease, carefully follow accepted treatment protocols, and teach youth comprehensive sexuality education including regular condom use. Funded research is needed to develop improved diagnosis and management tools as well as a chlamydia vaccine."
0,"Cumulative risk of chlamydial infection among young women in Florida, 2000-2011",10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.02.006,"PURPOSE: Chlamydia trachomatis is a very common infection among young women in the United States; information on cumulative risk of infection is limited. We sought to estimate the cumulative risk of chlamydial infection for young women. METHODS: We measured cumulative risk of reported chlamydial infection for 14- to 34-year-old women in Florida between 2000 and 2011 using surveillance records and census estimates. We calculated reported infections per woman, analyzed first infections to get cumulative risk, and calculated risk of repeat infection over the 12-year period. RESULTS: There were 457,595 infections reported among 15- to 34-year-old women. Reports increased annually from 25,390 to 51,536. Nineteen-year-olds were at highest risk with 5.1 infections reported per 100 women in 2011. There were 341,671 different women infected. Among women aged 14-17 years in 2000, over 20% had at least one infection reported within 12 years, and among blacks, this risk was over 36%, and that underestimates risk because 18% of cases were missing race/ethnicity information. Repeat infections were common. Among 53,109 with chlamydia at the age of 15-20 years during 2000-2003, 36.7% had additional infections reported by 2011. CONCLUSIONS: More than one out of five women in Florida was reported as having chlamydia during her young-adult years; risk was highest for black women. True infection risks were likely much higher because many infections were not diagnosed or reported. Young women who had chlamydia were very likely to get reinfected. Rates of infection remain high despite years of screening. More information is needed on how to prevent chlamydial infection."
0,The Future of Sexually Transmitted Infection Research: Understanding Adolescent Perspectives for Implementation of a Chlamydia Vaccine.,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2023.01.021,"PURPOSE: Despite advancements in developing a vaccine for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), vaccine hesitancy has historically limited the adoption of sexually  transmitted infection immunization. This report investigates adolescent  perspectives toward a potential CT vaccine and vaccine research. METHODS: As part  of the Technology Enhanced Community Health Nursing (TECH-N) study, conducted  from 2012-2017, we surveyed 112 adolescents and young adults aged 13-25 years who  presented with pelvic inflammatory disease regarding their perspectives on a CT  vaccine and willingness to participate in vaccine research. Descriptive  statistical analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Most participants were African  American (95%), on Medicaid (89%), and sexually experienced (100%). Most  respondents would accept a vaccine (95%) and preferred a provider's  recommendation (86%) over parents, partners, or friends. A majority (70%) would  not be embarrassed to participate in research. DISCUSSION: Respondents showed  favorable attitudes toward CT vaccination and research in this high-risk study  population."
0,Ectopic pregnancy: a review,10.1007/s00404-013-2929-2,"PURPOSE: Ectopic pregnancy (EP) presents a major health problem for women of child-bearing age. EP refers to the pregnancy occurring outside the uterine cavity that constitutes 1.2-1.4 % of all reported pregnancies. All identified risk factors are maternal: pelvic inflammatory disease, Chlamydia trachomatis infection, smoking, tubal surgery, induced conception cycle, and endometriosis. These developments have provided the atmosphere for trials using methotrexate as a non-surgical treatment for EP. The diagnosis measure of EP is serum human chorionic gonadotropin, urinary hCGRP/i-hCG, progesterone measurement, transvaginal ultrasound scan, computed tomography, vascular endothelial growth factor, CK, disintegrin and metalloprotease-12 and hysterosalpingography. The treatment option of EP involves surgical treatment by laparotomy or laparoscopy, medical treatment is usually systemic or through local route, or by expectant treatment. RESULTS: It was concluded that review data reflect a decrease in surgical treatment and not an actual decline in EP occurrence so that further new avenues are needed to explore early detection of the EP."
0,Investigation of fluoroquinolone resistance mechanism in Mycoplasma hominis isolated from urogenital samples in a Chinese hospital,10.1099/jmm.0.000913,"PURPOSE: Mycoplasma hominis is considered among the causes of urogenital infections and shows increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones. However, data regarding the fluoroquinolone resistance mechanism of M. hominis in Southwest China are limited. This study aimed to investigate gene mutations of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of M. hominis isolated from clinical urogenital samples in a Chinese hospital. METHODOLOGY: Strains of M. hominis were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of fluoroquinolones were determined by the broth microdilution method, following CLSI guidelines. PCR was used to amplify the QRDRs of the genes gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE. Positive products were sequenced, and gene mutations and amino acid substitutions were analysed by DNAMAN software and BLAST. RESULTS: The resistance rates of M. hominis to ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin (LVX), moxifloxacin (MXF) and gatifloxacin (GAT) were 90.5, 85.7, 73.8 and 71.4 %, respectively. A total of 57 isolates of M. hominis were screened, among which 52 strains demonstrated different resistant phenotypes to fluoroquinolones, 41 harboured amino acid substitutions of GyrA S153L, 51 harboured ParC S91I and 22 harboured ParC K144R. ParE A463S and ParC A154T were recorded for the first time and no amino acid change was detected in GyrB. CONCLUSION: The resistance of M. hominis to fluoroquinolones in Southwest China is mainly related to mutations in QRDRs of either gyrA or parC. High-level resistance is associated with mutations in both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV."
0,Sexually Transmitted Infection Review for the Acute Care Pharmacist,10.1177/0897190018764567,"PURPOSE: Review selected sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and treatment recommendations for pharmacists and providers practicing in the acute care setting. SUMMARY: In 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published an updated guideline on the treatment of STIs with an emphasis on prevention and new diagnostic strategies to combat the growing problem of STIs in the United States. Despite this guidance, the incidence of infection has continued to grow. In October 2016, an in-depth analysis reported that 20 million new infections occur annually in the United States. With this growing burden of disease, it is pertinent that health-care providers optimize their treatment strategies to improve upon the management of STIs. Focusing on identification of asymptomatic- and symptomatic-infected persons, treatment, education, effective follow-up, and counseling for patients and sexual partners, emergency medicine pharmacists and providers can help minimize the negative long-term health consequences of STIs. CONCLUSION: In the emergency department setting, clinical pharmacists and providers can play a crucial role in preventing and treating STIs and should continue to expand and keep current their knowledge of this topic."
0,"Prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and related factors among female prisoners in Tehran, Iran",10.1108/IJPH-09-2022-0055,"PURPOSE: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be transferred from one person to another through sexual contact. STIs lead to substantial morbidity and mortality and affect many different aspects of human life, including quality of life, sexual health, reproductive health and even the health of newborns and children. Despite of high rates of STIs in prisons, there are not sufficient screening, prevention and treatment programs to control STIs transmission among prisoners in Iran. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of STIs among incarcerated women in Iran for the first time, using the active case finding strategy. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This is a cross-sectional study conducted on 438 incarcerated women in a prison in Tehran, Iran, from 2017 to 2018. A total of 438 prisoners were screened by active case findings for STI symptoms, then evaluated by complete genital and anal examination, followed by molecular testing. FINDINGS: A total of 189 (43.2%) prisoners announced vaginal discharge, while 194 (44.3%) individuals had vaginal discharge in the genital examination. In the cervical examination, 137 individuals (31.3%) had abnormal findings, of which 83 (18.9%) individuals had cervicitis, 40 (9.1%) individuals had cervical erosion, 38 (8.7%) individuals had cervical prolapse and 17 (3.9%) individuals had bleeding originated from the cervix. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This study showed that it is possible to set up a system in which the diagnosis, follow-up and treatment of prisoners with STIs can be actively performed. Educating prisoners about signs and symptoms, risk behaviors and prevention routes of STIs, as much as regular screening of prisoners, and adequate treatment can help control the STIs prevalence among prisoners and in the general population."
0,Cytokine-induced expression of nitric oxide synthases in Chlamydia trachomatis-infected spontaneous aborters,10.1080/14767058.2018.1465914,"Purpose: The aim of study was to evaluate expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)-infected spontaneous aborters (SA). Materials and methods: Endometrial curettage tissue was collected from 140 SA (sporadic SA- 70; recurrent SA- 70) (Group I) and 140 age-matched controls (Group II) from Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, India. Polymerase chain reaction was performed for diagnosis of CT. The expression of iNOS/ eNOS/ IFN-γ/ TNF-α was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: 15.7% SA were CT-positive (Group I); none in controls. Sporadic spontaneous aborters (SSA) (n = 8/70), recurrent spontaneous aborters (RSA) (n = 14/70) diagnosed as CT-positive (Group-I). Significant upregulation of iNOS/ eNOS was found in CT-positive SSA/RSA compared with CT-negative SSA/RSA and healthy controls. TNF-α and IFN-γ were expressed in CT-positive SSA/RSA compared with negative SSA/controls. iNOS showed a significant strong positive correlation with TNF-α and IFN-γ in CT-infected SA. eNOS showed a significant positive correlation with TNF-α and no correlation with IFN-γ in CT-infected SA. TNF-α was positively correlated with IFN-γ. Conclusions: Significantly high expression of iNOS/ eNOS and proinflammatory cytokines affected pregnancy in CT-infected RSA, thereby implying that there occurs cytokine-induced expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS)."
0,Usefulness of 11C-choline positron emission tomography for genital chlamydial infection assessment in a BALB/c murine model,10.1007/s11307-013-0612-4,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of 11C-Choline PET in the assessment of the degree of inflammation in the Chlamydia muridarum genital infection model. PROCEDURES: Forty female Balb/c mice received 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate i.m. 9 and 2 days prior to the infection: 21 mice were infected by C. muridarum into the vaginal vault, 12 mice were treated with inactivated chlamydiae, and 7 mice were SPG buffer-treated as negative controls. Three healthy control mice were not treated with progesterone. Mice in each category were randomly subdivided in two groups: (1) sacrificed at 5, 10, 15, and 20 days for histological analysis and (2) undergoing 11C-Choline PET at days 5, 10, and 20 post-infection (20 MBq of 11C-Choline, uptake time of 10 min, acquisition through a small-animal PET tomograph for 15 min). RESULTS: Infected animals showed a significantly higher standardized uptake value than both controls and animals inoculated with heat-inactivated chlamydiae in each PET scan (P<0.05). All organs of the infected animals had scores of inflammation ranging between 2 and 3 at day 5, decreasing to 1-2 at day 20. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary result demonstrated that 11C-Choline PET can highlight a specific proliferation mechanism of inflammatory cells induced by C. muridarum, thanks to a very high sensitivity in detecting very small amounts of tracer in inflammatory cells."
1,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Michigan's School-Wide Sexually Transmitted Disease Screening Program in Four Detroit High Schools,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.05.014,"PURPOSE: The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with St. John Providence Health System, initiated voluntary school-wide sexually transmitted disease (STD) screenings in four Detroit public high schools. We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of the STD screening program from 2010 to 2015, with a focus on chlamydia. METHODS: The costs and effectiveness of the school-based screening were compared with those of a ""no school screening"" scenario using a healthcare system perspective. A decision tree model was constructed to project cases of chlamydia, epididymitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in each of the two scenarios among students tested positive and their partners. Health effects were measured as cases of PID prevented, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Cost estimates included program costs, chlamydia testing/treatment costs in the absence of school screening, and treatment costs for epididymitis, PID, and PID sequelae. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was measured as cost/QALY gained. Multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted on key parameter estimates and assumptions used. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, at a total program cost of $333,848 over 5 years, the program prevented an estimated 1.9 cases of epididymitis and 17.3 cases of PID, resulting in an ICER of $38,235/QALY gained (yearly ICER ranging from $27,417 to $50,945/QALY). Of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulation runs, the yearly ICER remained ≤$50,000/QALY in 64%-98% of the simulation runs. CONCLUSIONS: We found favorable cost-effectiveness ratios for Michigan's school-wide STD screening program in Detroit. School-based STD screening programs of this type warrant careful considerations by policy makers and program planners."
0,Does the Degree of Perihepatitis Have Any Relevance to the Severity of the Manifestations of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease on Multidetector Computed Tomography?,10.1097/RCT.0000000000000291,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the degree of perihepatitis and the severity of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). METHODS: A total of 177 women with PID who underwent biphasic abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans were enrolled. Two reviewers retrospectively reviewed the CT scans with consensus and subjectively categorized the severity of PID into 4 grades (normal, mild, moderate, and severe). Another reviewer independently assigned the extent (grades 0 to 4) and the depth (grades 0 to 4) of hepatic surface enhancement in terms of the degree of perihepatitis. Relationships between the degree of perihepatitis and the CT severity as well as each CT manifestation of PID were evaluated using the χ test or a cumulative logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 177 patients, 99 (55.9%) showed hepatic surface enhancement. The severity of PID on MDCT was significantly related with the degree of perihepatitis (all P < 0.001). Salpingitis, oophoritis, pelvic fat haziness, complicated ascites, and omental/mesenteric fat infiltration were significantly related with the degree of perihepatitis (all P < 0.05). Among these variables, omental/mesenteric fat infiltration (odds ratio = 10.9) and salpingitis (odds ratio = 6.0) were the CT manifestations that were most associated with the presence of perihepatitis in PID. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of perihepatitis seems to show a relationship with the severity of PID on MDCT. Omental/mesenteric fat infiltration and salpingitis can be strongly related with perihepatitis in PID."
0,"Development, validation and testing costs of an in-house real-time PCR assay for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis",10.1099/jmm.0.000443,"PURPOSE: To improve the screening of Chlamydia trachomatis(C. trachomatis) in Brazil, an accurate and affordable method is needed. The objective of this study was to develop and assess the performance and costs of a new in-house real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for the diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection. METHODOLOGY: Asymptomatic women aged 14-25 years who attended primary health services in Manaus, Brazil, were screened for C. trachomatis using the Digene Hybrid Capture II CT-ID (HCII CT-ID) DNA test. A subset of cervical specimens were tested using an in-house qPCR and a commercial qPCR, ArtusC. trachomatis Plus RG PCR 96 CE (Artus qPCR) kit, as a reference test. A primer/probe based on the sequence of cryptic plasmid (CP) was designed. An economic evaluation was conducted from the provider's perspective. RESULTS: The primers were considered specific for C. trachomatis because they did not amplify any product from non-sexually transmitted bacterial species tested. Overall, 292 specimens were tested by both the commercial kit (Artus qPCR) and the in-house qPCR. Of those, one resulted in no amplification and was excluded from the analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the in-house qPCR were 99.5 % [95 % confidence interval (CI): 97.1-100], 95.1 % (95 % CI: 89-98.4), 97.4 % (95 % CI: 94-99.1) and 99.0 % (95 % CI: 94.5-100), respectively. The cost per case of C. trachomatis was £0.44 ($0.55) for HCII CT-ID, £1.16 ($1.45) for Artus qPCR and £1.06 ($1.33) for in-house qPCR. CONCLUSION: We have standardized an in-house qPCR to detect cervical C. trachomatis targeting CP. The in-house qPCR showed excellent accuracy and was more affordable than the commercial qPCR kit."
0,Development and Evaluation of a Point-of-Care Test in a Low-Resource Setting with High Rates of Chlamydia trachomatis Urogenital Infections in Fiji,10.1128/JCM.00182-21,"Rapid and precise detection of Chlamydia trachomatis, the leading global cause of sexually transmitted infections (STI), at the point of care (POC) is required for treatment decisions to prevent transmission and sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, tubal factor infertility, and preterm birth. We developed a rapid POC test (POCT), termed LH-POCT, which uses loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) of nucleic acids. We performed a head-to-head comparison with the Cepheid Xpert CT/NG assay using clinician-collected, deidentified paired vaginal samples from a parent study that consecutively enrolled symptomatic and asymptomatic females over 18 years of age from the Ministry of Health and Medical Services Health Centers in Fiji. Samples were processed by the Xpert CT/NG assay and LH-POCT, blinded to the comparator. Discrepant samples were resolved by quantitative PCR. Deidentified clinical data and tests for Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida, and bacterial vaginosis (BV) were provided. There were a total of 353 samples from 327 females. C. trachomatis positivity was 16.7% (59/353), while the prevalence was 16.82% (55/327) after discrepant resolution. Seven discrepant samples resolved to four false negatives, two false positives, and one true positive for the LH-POCT. The sensitivity of the LH-POCT was 93.65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.53% to 98.24%), and specificity was 99.31% (95% CI, 97.53% to 99.92%). Discrepant samples clustered among women with vaginal discharge and/or BV. The prototype LH-POCT workflow has excellent performance, meeting many World Health Organization ASSURED criteria for POC tests, including a sample-to-result time of 35 min. Our LH-POCT holds promise for improving clinical practice to prevent and control C. trachomatis STIs in diverse health care settings globally."
0,Chronic endometritis due to common bacteria is prevalent in women with recurrent miscarriage as confirmed by improved pregnancy outcome after antibiotic treatment,10.1177/1933719113508817,"Recurrent miscarriage (RM) is defined as 3 or more miscarriages before 20 weeks' pregnancy. In recent years, interest has been focused on chronic endometritis (CE), a subtle inflammation thought to be associated with RM. We aimed to evaluate the relationships between CE and RM. The records of 360 women with unexplained RM were retrospectively analyzed. Data from hysteroscopy, endometrial histology, endometrial culture, and polymerase chain reaction for chlamydia, performed before and after antibiotic treatment for CE, were analyzed. The occurrence of successful pregnancies within 1 year after treatment was also evaluated. Results showed that 208 (57.8%) women with RM showed CE at hysteroscopy; 190 (91.3%), positive at hysteroscopy, were also positive at histology, and 142 (68.3%) had positive cultures. Common bacteria were found in 110 (77.5%) patients. Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma were found in 36 (25.3%) patients and Chlamydia in 18 patients (12.7%). In 102 (71%) women, antibiogram-based antibiotic treatment normalized hysteroscopy, histology, and cultures (group 1); while in 40 (28.2%) patients, CE was still present at hysteroscopy (group 2). In 16 of the 66 patients positive at hysteroscopy, but not at cultures, the hysteroscopy becomes normal (group 3) after a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-based therapy; while in 50 women, CE was still present (group 4). One year after treatment, group 1 showed a significantly higher number of pregnancies (78.4%) compared to group 2 (17.5%; P < .001) and group 4 (15.3%; P = .005). The CE is frequent in women with RM. Antibiotic treatment seems to be associated with an improved reproductive outcome."
1,[Recurrent Urogynecological Infections],10.1024/1661-8157/a003368,"Recurrent Urogynecological Infections Abstract. Changes in the urogenital microbiome of the bladder, urethra, vagina and cervix can cause recurrent infections. We distinguish between obligate and facultative pathogens. In the case of facultative pathogens, treatment with antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal drugs should only be considered in cases with attributable symptoms. Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) manifest either urogenitally alone or in association with an ascending infection of the adnexa as a pelvic inflammatory disease. STD may be asymptomatic, as in cases of chlamydia, or may cause a high burden of symptoms, impairment of quality of life or infertility. The aim of this minireview is to give an overview of the pathogenicity of the different germs and their treatment."
0,Chlamydia trachomatis infection in HIV-infected women: need for screening by a sensitive and specific test,10.1155/2013/960769,"Reproductive tract infection (RTIs)/sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are recognized as a major public health problem, particularly due to their relationship with HIV infection. Early detection and treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection (CTI) among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women may impact heterosexual HIV transmission. A total of 120 participants were enrolled: 30 HIV seropositive women with symptoms of RTIs, 30 HIV seropositive women without symptoms of RTIs, 30 HIV seronegative women with symptoms of RTIs, and 30 HIV seronegative women without symptoms of RTIs. One endocervical swab was collected from all participants and CTI was detected by real-time PCR (COBAS TaqMan CT Test, v2.0). CTI was detected in 4 (6.67%) HIV-infected women and in 1 (1.67%) HIV-uninfected woman (OR 4.214; 95% CI 0.457-38.865). Vaginal discharge was present in almost half of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women; lower abdominal pain was present in 11 (18.3%) of HIV-infected and in 9 (15%) of HIV-uninfected women. This study showed that CTI is more prevalent among HIV-infected females as compared to HIV-uninfected females. As the use of real-time PCR is not feasible in most hospitals, efforts should be made to develop a simple, sensitive, and specific test to identify women with CTI for prevention of sequelae and HIV transmission."
0,Sexual Assault Infectious Disease Prophylaxis.,,"Sexual assault is any sexual act performed by one person on another without seeking consent. The assault may result from the threat of force, force, or from  the victim's inability or refusal to give consent. Sexually transmitted  infections (STIs) are feared sequelae of sexual assault. The most common STIs  diagnosed in female survivors of sexual assault are chlamydia, gonorrhea,  bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis.  Prevention is paramount as survivors  who contract infections risk enduring long-term complications, including pelvic  inflammatory disease, infertility, and even certain types of cancer.  Recommendations for appropriate management after a sexual assault have changed  several times over the last decade. The treatment of STIs following sexual  assault exhibits variability between countries and within the same country. Local  factors such as antibiotic resistance patterns and prevalent infections in the  region often influence these differences. The prevalence of infection and  antibiotic susceptibility are dynamic and subject to ongoing changes; new  sexually acquired infections can emerge, exemplified by the advent of HIV in the  1980s. Over the past half-century, significant advancements have been made in  developing effective medications to combat various STIs, including HIV. The  information provided adheres to the current guidelines established by the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO)."

There are major uncertainties in the evidence base surrounding the delivery of STI care for men., To improve the sexual health of young men in the UK by determining optimal strategies for STI testing and care, To develop an evidence-based clinical algorithm for STI testing in asymptomatic men; model mathematically the epidemiological and economic impact of removing microscopy from routine STI testing in asymptomatic men; conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of accelerated partner therapy (APT; new models of partner notification to rapidly treat male sex partners of people with STIs) in primary care; explore the acceptability of diverse venues for STI screening in men; and determine optimal models for the delivery of screening., Systematic review of the clinical consequences of asymptomatic non-chlamydial, non-gonococcal urethritis (NCNGU); case–control study of factors associated with NCNGU; mathematical modelling of the epidemiological and economic impact of removing microscopy from asymptomatic screening and cost-effectiveness analysis; pilot RCT of APT for male sex partners of women diagnosed with Chlamydia trachomatis infection in primary care; stratified random probability sample survey of UK young men; qualitative study of men’s views on accessing STI testing; SPORTSMART pilot cluster RCT of two STI screening interventions in amateur football clubs; and anonymous questionnaire survey of STI risk and previous testing behaviour in men in football clubs., General population, genitourinary medicine clinic attenders, general practice and community contraception and sexual health clinic attenders and amateur football clubs., Men and women., Partner notification interventions: APTHotline [telephone assessment of partner(s)] and APTPharmacy [community pharmacist assessment of partner(s)]. SPORTSMART interventions: football captain-led and health adviser-led promotion of urine-based STI screening., For the APT pilot RCT, the primary outcome, determined for each contactable partner, was whether or not they were considered to have been treated within 6 weeks of index diagnosis. For the SPORTSMART pilot RCT, the primary outcome was the proportion of eligible men accepting screening., Non-chlamydial, non-gonococcal urethritis is not associated with significant clinical consequences for men or their sexual partners but study quality is poor (systematic review). Men with symptomatic and asymptomatic NCNGU and healthy men share similar demographic, behavioural and clinical variables (case–control study). Removal of urethral microscopy from routine asymptomatic screening is likely to lead to a small rise in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) but could save > £5M over 20 years (mathematical modelling and health economics analysis). In the APT pilot RCT the proportion of partners treated by the APTHotline [39/111 (35%)], APTPharmacy [46/100 (46%)] and standard patient referral [46/102 (45%)] did not meet national standards but exceeded previously reported outcomes in community settings. Men’s reported willingness to access self-sampling kits for STIs and human immunodeficiency virus infection was high. Traditional health-care settings were preferred but sports venues were acceptable to half of men who played sport (random probability sample survey). Men appear to prefer a ‘straightforward’ approach to STI screening, accessible as part of their daily activities (qualitative study). Uptake of STI screening in the SPORTSMART RCT was high, irrespective of arm [captain led 28/56 (50%); health-care professional led 31/46 (67%); poster only 31/51 (61%)], and costs were similar. Men were at risk of STIs but previous testing was common., Men find traditional health-care settings the most acceptable places to access STI screening. Self-sampling kits in football clubs could widen access to screening and offer a public health impact for men with limited local sexual health services. Available evidence does not support an association between asymptomatic NCNGU and significant adverse clinical outcomes for men or their sexual partners but the literature is of poor quality. Similarities in characteristics of men with and without NCNGU precluded development of a meaningful clinical algorithm to guide STI testing in asymptomatic men. The mathematical modelling and cost-effectiveness analysis of removing all asymptomatic urethral microscopy screening suggests that this would result in a small rise in adverse outcomes such as PID but that it would be highly cost-effective. APT appears to improve outcomes of partner notification in community settings but outcomes still fail to meet national standards. Priorities for future work include improving understanding of men’s collective behaviours and how these can be harnessed to improve health outcomes; exploring barriers to and facilitators of opportunistic STI screening for men attending general practice, with development of evidence-based interventions to increase the offer and uptake of screening; further development of APT for community settings; and studies to improve knowledge of factors specific to screening men who have sex with men (MSM) and, in particular, how, with the different epidemiology of STIs in MSM and the current narrow focus on chlamydia, this could negatively impact MSM’s sexual health., The National Institute for Health Research Programme Grants for Applied Research programme."
0,Gene Expression Signatures Can Aid Diagnosis of Sexually Transmitted Infection-Induced Endometritis in Women,10.3389/fcimb.2018.00307,"Sexually transmitted infection (STI) of the upper reproductive tract can result in inflammation and infertility. A biomarker of STI-induced upper tract inflammation would be significant as many women are asymptomatic and delayed treatment increases risk of sequelae. Blood mRNA from 111 women from three cohorts was profiled using microarray. Unsupervised analysis revealed a transcriptional profile that distinguished 9 cases of STI-induced endometritis from 18 with cervical STI or uninfected controls. Using a hybrid feature selection algorithm we identified 21 genes that yielded maximal classification accuracy within our training dataset. Predictive accuracy was evaluated using an independent testing dataset of 5 cases and 10 controls. Sensitivity was evaluated in a separate test set of 12 women with asymptomatic STI-induced endometritis in whom cervical burden was determined by PCR; and specificity in an additional test set of 15 uninfected women with pelvic pain due to unknown cause. Disease module preservation was assessed in 42 women with a clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). We also tested the ability of the biomarker to discriminate STI-induced endometritis from other diseases. The biomarker was 86.7% (13/15) accurate in correctly distinguishing cases from controls in the testing dataset. Sensitivity was 83.3% (5/6) in women with high cervical Chlamydia trachomatis burden and asymptomatic endometritis, but 0% (0/6) in women with low burden. Specificity in patients with non-STI-induced pelvic pain was 86.7% (13/15). Disease modules were preserved in all 8 biomarker predicted cases. The 21-gene biomarker was highly discriminatory for systemic infections, lupus, and appendicitis, but wrongly predicted tuberculosis as STI-induced endometritis in 52.4%. A 21-gene biomarker can identify asymptomatic women with STI-induced endometritis that places them at risk for chronic disease development and discriminate STI-induced endometritis from non-STI pelvic pain and other diseases."
0,Sexually Transmitted Infections: Updates From the 2021 CDC Guidelines,,"Sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates are increasing for most nationally notifiable disease categories in the United States. The 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines provide several updated, evidence-based testing and treatment recommendations. The recommended treatment for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone monotherapy given intramuscularly, with dosing based on the patient's body weight. For chlamydia, doxycycline is the preferred treatment. A test-of-cure is recommended for all cases of pharyngeal gonorrhea and for rectal chlamydia if treated with azithromycin. Vaginal trichomoniasis should be treated with a seven-day regimen of metronidazole. Treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease routinely includes metronidazole with doxycycline and an increased dosage of ceftriaxone. Syphilis of less than one year's duration should be treated with a single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units. Syphilis of more than one year's or unknown duration should be treated with three consecutive weekly doses of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units each. A thorough evaluation for otic, ophthalmic, and neurologic symptoms is essential for anyone with syphilis because these complications can occur at any stage and require 10 to 14 days of treatment with intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G. Family physicians can reduce STI rates by taking a thorough sexual history, especially in teens and young adults, ordering screening tests and treatment based on the updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines, and collaborating with public health departments for disease reporting and partner services."

Sexually transmitted infections disproportionately affect reproductive-aged females aged 15-44 years, who account for 65% and 42% of the total reported C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae cases, respectively. Undiagnosed STIs can result in serious health complications that put women at an increased risk for pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal factor infertility. Many of these women are seen by physicians (eg, obstetrician-gynecologists, family medicine doctors, pediatricians) or other clinicians (eg, nurse practitioners, midwives, physician assistants) who care for women. These clinicians have the opportunity to help curb the continued increase in STI incidence rates with the implementation and use of expedited partner therapy. Expedited partner therapy is a proven effective health care practice that allows clinicians to give patients medications or prescriptions to distribute to their partners. Despite expedited partner therapy's proven effectiveness, there are barriers to its implementation that must be understood to enhance STI treatment and prevention efforts. In this commentary, we discuss these barriers, and appeal to women's health clinicians to implement or increase use of expedited partner therapy for the treatment of women with STIs and their sexual partners."
0,Travel-related sexually transmitted infections,10.5603/IMH.2015.0045,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among the most common notifiable health problems worldwide, with particularly high rates in developing countries. Men and women with multiple sexual partners at home or a previous history of STIs are more likely to have casual sexual exposure (CSE) while travelling. Over the last several decades 5% to even 50% of short-term travellers engaged in CSE during foreign trips. It is estimated that only 50% of travellers use condoms during casual sex abroad. Sexual contact with commercial sex workers is an exceptionally high-risk behaviour. The common risk factor is also young age. Adolescents and young adults constitute 25% of the sexually active population, but represent almost 50% of all new acquired STIs. Many STIs are asymptomatic and therefore can be difficult to identify and control. The clinical manifestation of STIs can be grouped into a number of syndromes, such as genital ulcer or erosion, urethral or vaginal discharge, pelvic inflammatory disease. STIs are divided into curable infections caused by bacteria (gonorrhoea, chlamydiasis, syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, granuloma inguinale) or protozoa (trichomoniasis) and incurable viral infections (genital herpes, genital warts, HIV). STIs are not only a cause of acute morbidity, but may result in complications including male and female infertility, ectopic pregnancy, cervical cancer, premature mortality or miscarriage. Monogamous sex with a stable, uninfected partner or sexual abstinence remains the only way to avoid the risk of becoming infected with STIs."

TFI is one of the most common causes of infertility, accounting for 30% of female fertility problems. STIs can also have an impact on pregnancy, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Escalating antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium represents a significant problem and can be therapeutically challenging. We present a comprehensive review of the current treatment options, as well as the molecular approach to this subject.

0,"Update to CDC's Treatment Guidelines for Gonococcal Infection, 2020",10.15585/mmwr.mm6950a6,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcal infections) have increased 63% since 2014 and are a cause of sequelae including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility and can facilitate transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (1,2). Effective treatment can prevent complications and transmission, but N. gonorrhoeae's ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance influences treatment recommendations and complicates control (3). In 2010, CDC recommended a single 250 mg intramuscular (IM) dose of ceftriaxone and a single 1 g oral dose of azithromycin for treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum as a strategy for preventing ceftriaxone resistance and treating possible coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis (4). Increasing concern for antimicrobial stewardship and the potential impact of dual therapy on commensal organisms and concurrent pathogens (3), in conjunction with the continued low incidence of ceftriaxone resistance and the increased incidence of azithromycin resistance, has led to reevaluation of this recommendation. This report, which updates previous guidelines (5), recommends a single 500 mg IM dose of ceftriaxone for treatment of uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonorrhea. If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, concurrent treatment with doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days) is recommended. Continuing to monitor for emergence of ceftriaxone resistance through surveillance and health care providers' reporting of treatment failures is essential to ensuring continued efficacy of recommended regimens."

Of note are the most common bacterial STIs, chlamydial  and gonococcal infections, whose etiological agents are Chlamydia trachomatis  (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), respectively. Despite being usually  asymptomatic, in some cases these infections can be associated with long-term  severe complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain,  infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and increased risk of other STIs acquisition. As  the symptoms, when present, are usually similar in both infections, and in most  of the cases these infections co-occur, the dual-test strategy, searching for  both pathogens, should be preferred. In line with this, herein we focus on the  main aspects of CT and NG infections, the clinical symptoms as well as the  appropriate state-of-the-art diagnostic tests and treatment. Cost-effective  strategies for controlling CT and NG infections worldwide are addressed. The  treatment for both infections is based on antibiotics. However, the continuing  global rise in the incidence of these infections, concomitantly with the  increased risk of antibiotics resistance, leads to difficulties in their control,  particularly in the case of NG infections. We also discuss the potential  mechanism of tumorigenesis related to CT infections. The molecular bases of CT  and NG infections are addressed, as they should provide clues for control or  eradication, through the development of new drugs and/or effective vaccines  against these pathogens."
1,Sexually Transmitted Infections Part 2: Discharge Syndromes and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,10.1542/pir.2019-0078,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect young people, with more than half of the infections occurring in youth aged 15 to 25 years.

Most infected persons, however, are asymptomatic. Nucleic acid amplification tests are the most sensitive and specific for the detection of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, and they can be performed on provider- or patient-collected swabs. Providers should have a low threshold for diagnosing and treating PID because untreated PID can have serious long-term complications for young women. Indications for hospitalization for PID include the presence of a tubo-ovarian abscess, severe illness with systemic symptoms, pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and failure to respond to outpatient oral treatment (within 48-72 hours) or inability to tolerate the oral treatment."

Although the research shows that STIs are still reported in the military, the epidemiological risk for contracting a sexually transmitted infection is much lower nowadays than it was in the past. It is important, however, that service members are routinely screened for sexually transmitted diseases. Because of a high prevalence of STIs in the general population as well as the asymptomatic nature of some infections (e.g. HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis), screening of the sexually active service personnel is recommended as a practical method of preventing the spread of STIs and their sequelae, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility in women or epididymitis, prostatitis, infertility in men. The rates of STIs in service members have been on the increase in recent years, which may be associated with the fact that more and more women are now seeking a career in the armed forces. Currently, STIs do not only affect male soldiers or their civilian sexual partners (either long-term or casual), but both male and female soldiers alike, especially if they are serving together. The article focuses on the prevalence of STIs in the military in the past and at present, the common STI risk factors and prevention measures."

After releasing  restrictions, a major STI rebound occurred in 2021. Increases were 49% for  gonorrhea, 45% for HIV, 39% for chlamydia, and 32% for syphilis. Based on  nationwide statistics, we build a narrative review of the recent STI surge after  COVID-19. In summary, we propose a holistic approach to confront the current  re-emergence of STI. On one hand, new innovative medical advances must be  implemented, including new rapid tests, novel vaccines, pre-exposure prophylaxis  beyond HIV, and long-acting antivirals. On the other hand, information to  citizens needs to be reformulated with interventions aimed to build a healthier  society, alike it has been undertaken with tobacco, alcohol, diet, and lifestyle.  STI determines important sexual, reproductive, and maternal-child health  consequences. To promote human well-being or flourishing, the education of  adolescents and young adults should be aligned with human ecology. Therefore, it  is urgent to address new approaches in sexual health that represent a clear  benefit for individual persons and society. In this way, favoring a cultural  evolution aimed to delay the age of first sexual intercourse and the avoidance of  multiple sex partners should be prioritized."
0,Syndromic Treatment of STIs in Low-income Countries is Inadequate: Current Threats and Future Directions,10.1097/GRF.0000000000000714,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) pose a serious public health threat with more than 1 million curable infections diagnosed every day. While these infections are prevalent globally, the approach to evaluation and treatment varies greatly based on the capacity to make an accurate diagnosis. In low-resource settings, a syndromic approach is often used over an etiologic-based evaluation and management. Syndromic treatment of STIs recognizes groups of symptoms and recommends a multidrug empiric treatment that will cover the most likely causative organisms. By definition, syndromic treatment cannot be used as a screening tool, leaving a large portion of asymptomatic infections untreated. This will lead to the persistence of infection and associated sequelae including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Syndromic treatment also leads to the overtreatment of many infections, which contributes to antimicrobial resistance. The rising threat of Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistance to last-line antibiotics is of global concern. Rapid, accurate, affordable, and easy-to-use point-of-care testing needs to be made readily available to all corners of the world to provide better care to patients and address the growing threat of multidrug resistant organisms. An urgent and collaborative global effort is needed to address the looming threat of a dangerous STI that is resistant to last-line antibiotics."
0,Infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (including lymphogranuloma venereum) and Mycoplasma genitalium,10.1016/j.eimc.2019.01.014,"Sexually transmitted infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, including lymphogranuloma venereum and Mycoplasma genitalium have increased in last decade. This epidemiological scenario presents new challenges in order to improve and strengthen our control and prevention strategies. The routine clinical diagnosis of urethritis and cervicitis must be combined with the active search for the causal agent in men with symptoms of dysuria or proctitis, and in women with pelvic inflammatory disease. We should also include sexually transmitted infections screening in asymptomatic patients with sexual risk behaviours or sexual contact with patients diagnosed with an sexually transmitted infection. The microbiological diagnosis must be based on molecular techniques capable of detecting Chlamydia trachomatis (discriminating between L genotypes associated with lymphogranuloma venereum and other genotypes) and Mycoplasma genitalium (ideally including the identification of macrolide-resistant strains). A faster and specific diagnosis will allow for a targeted treatment with a suitable antibiotic regimen. We also recommend including contact tracing of sexual partners and, occasionally, a cure test. Finally, sexually transmitted infection screening must be widely implemented in those population groups with a high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections."
1,[Genitourethral infections caused by D-K serotypes of Chlamydia trachomatis],10.1556/OH.2015.30078,"Sexually transmitted infections of the urogenital tract are most commonly caused by the intracellular bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis worldwide, resulting the clinical picture of acute urethritis in men as well as urethritis and endocervicitis in women. As women often present with few symptoms only or a completely symptom-free disease course, one of the most important long-term complications is chronic pelvic inflammatory disease often followed by the development of infertility caused by chronic scar formation. Well-organized screening programs are considered to have a leading role in the prevention of disease spreading and long lasting unwanted complications. Antibiotic treatment options are often influenced by special circumstances, such as pregnancy and several complicated clinical forms. The aims of the authors are to give a concise review on the current knowledge regarding Chlamydia trachomatis infections and summarize typical clinical signs, modern diagnostic techniques as well as accepted treatment protocols and basic aspects of screening."
0,Discovery of Blood Transcriptional Endotypes in Women with Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,10.4049/jimmunol.1701658,"Sexually transmitted infections with Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae and rates of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women continue to rise, with reinfection being common because of poor adaptive immunity. Diagnosis remains imprecise, and pathogenesis data are derived primarily from monoinfection of mice with C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae By comparing blood mRNA responses of women with C. trachomatis- and/or N. gonorrhoeae-induced PID and histologic endometritis with those from women with C. trachomatis and/or N. gonorrhoeae infection limited to their cervix and asymptomatic uninfected women determined via microarray, we discovered important pathogenic mechanisms in PID and response differences that provide a pathway to biomarker discovery. Women with N. gonorrhoeae- and/or C. trachomatis-induced PID exhibit overexpression of myeloid cell genes and suppression of protein synthesis, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and T cell-specific genes. Coinfected women exhibited the greatest activation of cell death pathways and suppression of responses essential for adaptive immunity. Women solely infected with C. trachomatis expressed elevated levels of type I and type II IFN genes, and enhanced type I IFN-induced chemokines in cervical secretions were associated with ascension of C. trachomatis to the endometrium. Blood microarrays reveal discrete pathobiological endotypes in women with PID that are driven by pathogen invasion of the upper genital tract."
0,Sexual Assault Infectious Disease Prophylaxis,,"Sexually transmitted infections, STIs, are a feared sequela of sexual assault.  The most common sexually transmitted infections diagnosed in female survivors of sexual assault are chlamydia, gonorrhea, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis. Survivors who develop infections are burdened with long-term complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and some cancers, so prevention is highly desired. Recommendations for appropriate management after a sexual assault have changed several times over the last decade. Treatment for STI after sexual assault varies by country and sometimes within a country, depending on local resistance and patterns of infections. The prevalence of certain infections and antibiotic susceptibility continues to change and evolve. New sexually acquired infections may appear over time, like HIV in the 1980s. New medications that are effective against certain STIs, like HIV, have also been developed in the last half-century. The following information follows current recommendations made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO)."
0,Shift work influences the outcomes of Chlamydia infection and pathogenesis,10.1038/s41598-020-72409-5,"Shift work, performed by approximately 21 million Americans, is irregular or unusual work schedule hours occurring after 6:00 pm. Shift work has been shown to disrupt circadian rhythms and is associated with several adverse health outcomes and chronic diseases such as cancer, gastrointestinal and psychiatric diseases and disorders. It is unclear if shift work influences the complications associated with certain infectious agents, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility resulting from genital chlamydial infection. We used an Environmental circadian disruption (ECD) model mimicking circadian disruption occurring during shift work, where mice had a 6-h advance in the normal light/dark cycle (LD) every week for a month. Control group mice were housed under normal 12/12 LD cycle. Our hypothesis was that compared to controls, mice that had their circadian rhythms disrupted in this ECD model will have a higher Chlamydia load, more pathology and decreased fertility rate following Chlamydia infection. Results showed that, compared to controls, mice that had their circadian rhythms disrupted (ECD) had higher Chlamydia loads, more tissue alterations or lesions, and lower fertility rate associated with chlamydial infection. Also, infected ECD mice elicited higher proinflammatory cytokines compared to mice under normal 12/12 LD cycle. These results imply that there might be an association between shift work and the increased likelihood of developing more severe disease from Chlamydia infection."
1,Reported Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Are Decreasing Among Young Black Women: Good News or Bad News? A Narrative Review,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001491,"Since 2010, reported chlamydia and gonorrhea rates decreased among Black women aged 15 to 19 years and were stable for Black women aged 20 to 24 years in the United States. Rates increased for older Black women aged 25 to 39 years and all White women. The Black/White rate ratio decreased across age groups. We examined whether trends in reported rates reflected changing prevalence or changing screening. We analyzed trends in reported chlamydia and gonorrhea rates from 2010 to 2018 among women in the United States aged 15 to 39 years by age and race/ethnicity subgroup, state, and reporting source. Most jurisdictions reported decreased chlamydia and gonorrhea rates among Black teens and increased rates among White teens and older women. Between 2010 and 2018, public clinics reported fewer cases, especially among young Black women, that were not restored by increases elsewhere. We reviewed literature on trends in screening, prevalence, and sequelae. Family planning clinics annual reports showed chlamydia tests among women younger than 25 years decreased by 541,573 tests (-38%) in 2018 compared with 2010 and the number of women visiting sexually transmitted disease clinics had decreased 50% by 2016 compared with 2010. Prevalence of chlamydia in a sentinel population (Job Corps) was unchanged for Black women younger than 25 years and increased for Whites aged 20 to 24 years. Sequelae trends using data from a large all-payer emergency department database were mixed: pelvic inflammatory disease decreased, whereas ectopic pregnancy increased. Decreases in testing at public clinics likely missed diagnoses among young Black women, a group traditionally at highest risk and in need of more testing. Innovative approaches to screening are needed."
0,Screaming Body and Silent Healthcare Providers: A Case Study with a Childhood Sexual Abuse Survivor,10.3390/ijerph15010094,"Stressful early life experiences cause immune dysregulation across the lifespan. Despite the fact that studies have identified childhood sexual abuse (CSA) survivors as a particularly vulnerable group, only a few attempts have been made to study their lived-experience of the physical health consequences of CSA. The aim of this study was to explore a female CSA survivor's lived-experience of the physical health consequences of CSA and how she experienced the reactions of healthcare providers. Seven interviews were conducted with this 40-year-old woman, Anne, using a phenomenological research approach. Anne was still a young child (two to three years old) when her father started to rape her. Since her childhood, she has experienced complex and widespread physical health consequences such as repeated vaginal and abdominal infections, widespread and chronic pain, sleeping problems, digestive problems, chronic back problems, fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal problems, repeated urinary tract infections, cervical dysplasia, inflammation of the Fallopian tubes, menorrhagia, endometrial hyperplasia, chlamydia, ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancies, uterus problems, severe adhesions, and ovarian cancer. Anne disclosed her CSA experience to several healthcare providers but they were silent and failed to provide trauma-informed care. Anne's situation, albeit unique, might reflect similar problems in other female CSA survivors."
0,Use of a Rapid Diagnostic for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae for Women in the Emergency Department Can Improve Clinical Management: Report of a Randomized Clinical Trial,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2018.09.012,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: In emergency departments (EDs), diagnosis and treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are challenging. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to assess rapid C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae testing on overtreatment and undertreatment of women evaluated for C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae. METHODS: Women undergoing pelvic examinations and C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae testing (n=254) were randomized to control or rapid test groups. The control group received standard-of-care C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae nucleic acid amplification tests of endocervical specimens, with 2- to 3-day turnaround times. For the rapid test group, clinicians collected an extra endocervical swab for GeneXpert C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae rapid testing, in addition to the standard-of-care nucleic acid amplification test swab. Rapid results were immediately provided, and all patients were treated according to providers' clinical judgment. RESULTS: In the rapid test group, 7.9% of patients had positive test results for C trachomatis; 3.9% had positive test results for N gonorrhoeae. In the control standard-of-care group, 10.2% of patients had positive nucleic acid amplification test results for C trachomatis; 5.5% had positive results for N gonorrhoeae. Undertreatment for both C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae in the ED was 0% for the rapid test group and 43.8% for the control standard-of-care group. Clinicians overtreated 46.5% of uninfected standard-of-care control patients for C trachomatis compared with 23.1% of uninfected rapid test patients. For patients uninfected with N gonorrhoeae, clinicians overtreated 46.7% of standard-of-care control patients compared with 25.4% of rapid test patients. The length of stay did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSION: Rapid C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae testing in the ED led to a significant reduction in overtreatment for women without infections compared with the standard-of-care control group. Additionally, in the rapid test group there was significant improvement in appropriate treatment for patients with infections."
1,The Additive Value of Pelvic Examinations to History in Predicting Sexually Transmitted Infections for Young Female Patients With Suspected Cervicitis or Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2018.05.004,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the additive value of pelvic examinations in predicting sexually transmitted infection for young female patients with suspected cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease in a pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of female patients aged 14 to 20 years who presented to an urban academic pediatric ED with a complaint of vaginal discharge or lower abdominal pain. Enrolled patients provided a urine sample for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas testing, which served as the criterion standard for diagnosis. A practitioner (pediatric ED attending physician, emergency medicine or pediatric resident, pediatric ED fellow, or advanced practice provider) obtained a standardized history from the patient to assess for cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. They then recorded the likelihood of cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease on a 100-mm visual analog scale. The same practitioner then performed a pelvic examination and again recorded the likelihood of cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease on a visual analog scale with this additional information. Using the results of the urine sexually transmitted infection tests, the practitioner calculated and compared the test characteristics of history alone and history with pelvic examination. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-eight patients were enrolled, of whom 79 had positive urine test results for chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomonas, with a sexually transmitted infection rate of 27.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.6% to 32.8%). The sensitivity of history alone in diagnosis of cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease was 54.4% (95% CI 42.8% to 65.5%), whereas the specificity was 59.8% (95% CI 52.8% to 66.4%). The sensitivity of history with pelvic examination in diagnosis of cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease was 48.1% (95% CI 36.8% to 59.5%), whereas the specificity was 60.7% (95% CI 53.8% to 67.3%). The information from the pelvic examination changed management in 71 cases; 35 of those cases correlated with the sexually transmitted infection test and 36 did not. CONCLUSION: For young female patients with suspected cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease, the pelvic examination does not increase the sensitivity or specificity of diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomonas compared with taking a history alone. Because the test characteristics for the pelvic examination are not adequate, its routine performance should be reconsidered."
0,Prevalence of chronic endometritis in repeated unexplained implantation failure and the IVF success rate after antibiotic therapy,10.1093/humrep/deu292,"STUDY QUESTION: What is the prevalence of chronic endometritis (CE) in women with repeated unexplained implantation failure (RIF) at IVF, and how does antibiotic treatment affect the reproductive outcome? SUMMARY ANSWER: Chronic endometritis, associated with infection with common bacteria or mycoplasma, is common in women complaining of RIF and antibiotic treatment significantly improves the reproductive outcome at a subsequent IVF cycle. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: We have reported that CE is a frequent finding in women with repeated pregnancy loss and a significantly higher rate of successful pregnancies was achieved after adequate antibiotic treatment. Moreover, CE was identified in 30.3% of patients with repeated implantation failure at IVF and women diagnosed with CE had lower implantation rates (11.5%) after IVF cycles. In contrast, other authors reported that the clinical implication of CE should be considered minimal and that the reproductive outcome at IVF/ICSI cycles was not negatively affected by CE. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective study was performed from January 2009 through June 2012 on 106 women with unexplained infertility and a history of RIF. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All patients underwent hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling for histology and microbiological investigations. Women diagnosed with CE underwent antibiotic treatment and the effect of treatment was confirmed by hysteroscopy with biopsy. Within 6 months after treatment all women had a further IVF attempt. The IVF outcomes were compared in women without signs of CE (Group 1) and persistent CE (Group 2) after antibiotic treatment. Clinical pregnancy rate (PR), and live birth rate (LBR) were compared at post-treatment IVF attempt. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Seventy (66.0%) women were diagnosed with CE at hysteroscopy. In 61 (57.5%) CE was confirmed by histology and 48 (45.0%) by cultures. Common bacteria and mycoplasma were the most prevalent agents. In 46 (75.4%) out of 61 women, with diagnosis of CE at hysteroscopy and histology, examinations were normal after appropriate antibiotic treatment control (Group 1) while in 15 (24.6%) cases signs of CE were still present (Group 2). At IVF attempt after treatment, a significantly higher PR and LBR was reported in women from Group 1 compared with women from Group 2 (65.2 versus 33.0% P = 0.039; 60.8 versus 13.3%, P = 0.02, respectively). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Possible biases related to retrospective studies and to preferential referral of patients with CE, and limited number of cases. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A prospective randomized clinical trial is needed to confirm our findings but in women with RIF a hysteroscopic evaluation of the uterine cavity to exclude CE should be considered and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be given before submitting the patient to a further IVF attempt."
0,Background review for the '2015 European guideline on the management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections',10.1177/0956462415618838,"SummaryChlamydia trachomatis infections are major public health concerns globally. Of particular grave concern is that the majority of persons with anogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infections are asymptomatic and accordingly not aware of their infection, and this silent infection can subsequently result in severe reproductive tract complications and sequelae. The current review paper provides all background, evidence base and discussions for the 2015 European guideline on the management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections (Lanjouw E, et al. Int J STD AIDS 2015). Comprehensive information and recommendations are included regarding the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of anogenital, pharyngeal and conjunctival Chlamydia trachomatis infections in European countries. However, Chlamydia trachomatis also causes the eye infection trachoma, which is not a sexually transmitted infection. The 2015 European Chlamydia trachomatis guideline provides up-to-date guidance regarding broader indications for testing and treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infections; clearer recommendation of using validated nucleic acid amplification tests only for diagnosis; advice on (repeated) Chlamydia trachomatis testing; recommendation of increased testing to reduce the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease and prevent exposure to infection and recommendations to identify, verify and report Chlamydia trachomatis variants. Improvement of access to testing, test performance, diagnostics, antimicrobial treatment and follow-up of Chlamydia trachomatis patients are crucial to control its spread."
0,"Relationship between female genital tract infections, mucosal interleukin-17 production and local T helper type 17 cells",10.1111/imm.12527,"T helper type 17 (Th17) cells play an important role in immunity to fungal and bacterial pathogens, although their role in the female genital tract, where exposure to these pathogens is common, is not well understood. We investigated the relationship between female genital tract infections, cervicovaginal interleukin-17 (IL-17) concentrations and Th17 cell frequencies. Forty-two cytokines were measured in cervicovaginal lavages from HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women. Frequencies of Th17 cells (CD3(+) CD4(+) IL-17a(+)) were evaluated in cervical cytobrushes and blood by flow cytometry. Women were screened for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis and herpes simplex virus 2 by PCR, and candidal infections and bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain. Women with bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), specifically chlamydia and gonorrhoea, had higher genital IL-17 concentrations than women with no STI, whereas women with candidal pseudohyphae/spores had lower IL-17 concentrations compared with women without candidal infections. Viral STIs (herpes simplex virus 2 and HIV) were not associated with significant changes in genital IL-17 concentrations. Genital IL-17 concentrations correlated strongly with other inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Although Th17 cells were depleted from blood during HIV infection, cervical Th17 cell frequencies were similar in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women. Cervical Th17 cell frequencies were also not associated with STIs or candida, although few women had a STI. These findings suggest that IL-17 production in the female genital tract is induced in response to bacterial but not viral STIs. Decreased IL-17 associated with candidal infections suggests that candida may actively suppress IL-17 production or women with dampened IL-17 responses may be more susceptible to candidal outgrowth."
1,Recognition and treatment of chlamydial infections from birth to adolescence,10.1007/978-1-4614-4726-9_8,"The ""silent epidemic"" of Chlamydia trachomatis threatens to cause reproductive damage and infertility in many of the 50 million women who acquire it each year. Female reproductive tract infection has more recently been linked to stillbirth and premature delivery. Innate immune cells and mediators appear to be the primary players in pathogenesis, with neutrophils playing a prominent role in disease development. Although adaptive antibody and CD4 T cell responses appear primarily protective, these responses are inefficient. Infections are frequently chronic as a result, and when infection is diagnosed and treated with appropriate antibiotics, repeated infection is the rule. The lack of acute symptoms in many infected individuals contributes to the high prevalence of chlamydial infection. Although chronic sequelae are relatively rare in men, and many women sustain infection without developing pelvic inflammatory disease or chronic sequelae, the extremely high prevalence of chlamydial infection leads to significant morbidity and healthcare costs. A vaccine is urgently needed to prevent infection, but given the difficulties of inducing a CD4 T cell memory response that can home quickly to the genital tract, induction of sterilizing immunity may not be possible. A vaccine that prevents disease by lowering bacterial burden and dampening production of tissue-damaging responses may be possible. Until an efficacious vaccine is developed, screening and treatment programs appear to be the best method of disease prevention."

A cross-sectional study was performed with 112  HIV-uninfected and 41 HIV-infected nonindigenous women. Anal and cervical  scrapings were collected and analyzed for HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT),  Neisseria gonorrheae (NG), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), Mycoplasma genitalium  (MG), and Human alphaherpesvirus 2 (HSV-2). The Kappa test evaluated the  concordance between anal and genital infections. The overall prevalence of anal  HPV infection was 31.3% in HIV-uninfected and 97.6% in HIV-infected women. The  most frequent anal high-risk HPV (hrHPV) types were HPV18 and HPV16 in  HIV-uninfected women and HPV51, HPV59, HPV31, and HPV58 in HIV-infected women.  Anal HPV75 Betapapillomavirus was also identified. Anal non-HPV STIs were  identified in 13.0% of all participants. The concordance analysis was fair for  CT, MG, and HSV-2, almost perfect agreement for NG, moderate for HPV, and  variable for the most frequent anal hrHPV types. Thus, a high prevalence of anal  HPV infection with moderate and fair concordance between anal and genital HPV and  non-HPV STIs was observed in our study."
1,Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae PCR detection in women treated for ectopic pregnancy,10.1080/01443615.2021.1979947,"The aim of this study was to determine the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis (ChT) and Neisseria gonorrhoae (NG) in the genital tract of women with ectopic pregnancy and to compare the positive results with patients' self-reported history of PID. Overall 40 women were eligible for the study. The samples for the ChT and NG Polymerase Chain-reaction (PCR) detection were obtained from the cervix, endometrium and fallopian tube. The results of testing for NG at all sites were negative as were the results from cervical testing for ChT. The prevalence of ChT in the upper genital tract was 12.5%. No statistically significant correlation was found between the positive cases and the previous signs of PID and laparoscopic findings. We found statistically significant relationship between signs of pelvic inflammation in a pacients' history and histopathological findings of tubal inflammation. 12.5% prevalence of ChT confirms the ascending genital infection. There was no association between the positive PCR result and clinical history of pelvic inflammation.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Pelvic inflammatory disease, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoae infections are the main risks for ectopic pregnancy. Clinical history of PID and perioperative adhesions may suggest prior upper genital infection.What do the results of this study add? Chlamydia trachomatis positive PCR result can be found in the upper genital tract without the positivity of cervical smear in women with ectopic pregnancy. Our study is unique in assessing the endometrial biopsy for the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoae.What are the implications of these findings for future clinical practice and/or future clinical research? There is no statistically significant association between positive PCR result and clinical history of PID or pelvic adhesions found during laparoscopy for tubal pregnancy. Therefore there is no need for the preventive antibiotic treatment in patients with these findings."
0,The prevalence and the risk factors of the cervical colonization by the genital mycoplasmas among pregnant women from Eastern Croatia,,"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the genital mycoplasmas cervical colonization among the pregnant women from the Eastern Croatia and to evaluate its correlation with the demographic and the behavioural risk factors. Study was conducted from March 2010 to April 2011 at the Microbiology Department of the Institute of Public Health for the Osijek-Baranja County. The study included 456 pregnant women in the first and the second trimester of pregnancy. Demographic data and data on their possible risk behaviour during the lifetime were collected with the usage of an anonymous questionnaire consisting of the 16 questions. The Mycoplasma Duo kit test was used to diagnose the mycoplasma infections. Due to the fact that the results were generally similar for the women with U. urealyticum or M. hominis and in order to dichotomize the analyses, 164 (36%) participants with U. urealyticum, M. hominis or both were considered positive, whereas 292 (64%) participants without U. urealyticum or M. hominis were considered negative. A higher genital mycoplasmas prevalence was statistically significantly associated with the younger group of the pregnant women (16-29 y), 5 or more sexual partners during lifetime and the age on the first intercourse < or = 16. The study has showed that both the demographic and the behavioural risk factors were associated with the higher genital mycoplasmas colonization in the observed population."

We recruited 153 women for a cross-sectional study (112 HIV-uninfected and 41 HIV-infected) who sought health services. Anal and cervical scrapings and cervico-vaginal self-collection samples were collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction methods were used for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium. A syphilis test was also performed. Risk factors for STIs were identified by multivariate analysis. The overall prevalence of STIs was 30.4% (34/112) in HIV-uninfected women and 24.4% (10/41) in HIV-infected women. Anogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection was the most prevalent in both groups of women (20.5% vs 19.5%). There was significant agreement for each STI between self-collected and clinician-collected samples: 91.7%, kappa 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.85 for Chlamydia trachomatis; 99.2%, kappa 0.85, 95% CI 0.57-1.00 for Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 97.7%, kappa 0.39, 95% CI -0.16-0.94 for Trichomonas vaginalis; and 94.7%, kappa 0.51, 95% CI 0.20-0.82 for Mycoplasma genitalium. Women with human papillomavirus had coinfection or multiple infections with other STIs. Risk factors for STIs were being ≤ 25 years old, being employed or a student, reporting a history of STI and having a positive HPV test. A high prevalence of STIs in women in the Tapajós region was found. Cervico-vaginal self-collection is a useful tool for STI screening and can be used in prevention control programs in low-resource settings, such as in northern Brazil."
0,"Combined Testing for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Trichomonas by Use of the BD Max CT/GC/TV Assay with Genitourinary Specimen Types",10.1128/JCM.01766-16,"The BD Max CT/GC/TV (MAX) assay is a true multiplex assay for simultaneous detection of chlamydia (CT), gonorrhea (GC), and trichomonas (TV). We evaluated assay performance for women using endocervical and vaginal swabs as well as urine specimens. A total of 1,143 women were tested for CT, GC, and TV and, subsequently, another 847 (1,990 total women) for CT and GC only, with positivity rates for CT, GC, and TV of 7.1%, 2.3%, and 13.5%, respectively. In men, the performance for CT and GC was determined using only urine specimens. TV performance was not assessed in male urine samples. Among men, 181/830 (21.8%) and 108/840 (12.9%) chlamydia and gonorrhea infections, respectively, were identified. Comparator assays included BD ProbeTec Chlamydia trachomatis Qx (CTQ)/Neisseria gonorrhoeae Qx (GCQ), Hologic Aptima Combo 2 (AC2) and Aptima TV (ATV), trichomonas microscopy, and culture. MAX CT sensitivity was 99.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.1% to 99.9%), 95.7% (90.8% to 98.0%), 91.5% (85.8% to 95.1%), and 96.1% (92.2% to 98.1%) for vaginal swabs, endocervical swabs, female urine samples, and male urine samples, respectively. MAX GC sensitivity was 95.5% (84.9% to 98.7%), 95.5% (84.9% to 98.7%), 95.7% (85.5% to 99.8%), and 99.1% (94.9% to 99.8%) in the same order. MAX TV sensitivity was 96.1% (91.7% to 98.2%) for vaginal swabs, 93.4% (88.3% to 96.4%) for endocervical swabs, and 92.9% (87.8% to 96.0%) for female urine samples. Specificity for all organisms across all sample types was ≥98.6%. Performance estimates for the MAX assays were consistent with estimates calculated for the comparator assays (all P values were >0.1). The availability of a CT/GC/TV multiplexed assay on a benchtop instrument with a broad menu has the potential to facilitate local sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing at smaller laboratories and may encourage expanded screening for these highly prevalent infections."

0,Whole genome identification of C. trachomatis immunodominant antigens after genital tract infections and effect of antibiotic treatment of pigtailed macaques,10.1016/j.jprot.2014.05.009,"The cervix and/or fallopian tubes of pigtailed macaques were experimentally infected with Chlamydia trachomatis. Their sera were collected at varying time points and screened for identification of immunodominant antigens using a whole-genome protein microarray. The effect of doxycycline treatment on the antibody response generated in these macaques was also investigated. Twenty-five female macaques were infected with C. trachomatis serovars D or E in the cervix and/or fallopian tubes. Bloods were collected at baseline and at various intervals after challenge. Serum samples were tested for antibodies using a C. trachomatis serovar D protein microarray. Twenty chlamydial antigens reacted with sera from at least 68% (17/25) of the macaques. In addition to some well-known chlamydial antigens, nine different proteins, not previously recognized as immunodominant, including four hypothetical proteins (CT005, CT066, CT360 and CT578), were identified. Monkeys infected in the fallopian tubes developed a more robust antibody response than animals inoculated in the cervix. Treatment with doxycycline significantly decreased Chlamydia-specific antibody levels. In summary, using protein microarray serum samples from experimentally infected pigtailed macaques were screened for immunodominant chlamydial antigens. These antigens can now be tested in animal models for their ability to protect and as markers of disease progression. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first time that Chlamydia trachomatis immunodominant antigens have been identified in pigtailed macaques following a uterine cervix or a fallopian tubes infection. These immunodominant antigens can now be used to vaccinate non-human primates and determine their ability to protect against a C. trachomatis genital infection. Proteins that are protective can subsequently be tested in humans. Amongst the immunodominant antigens some were predominantly recognized by sera from macaques inoculated in the fallopian tubes rather than in the cervix and therefore, may be markers for upper genital tract pathology. In addition, treatment with doxycycline following infection significantly decreased Chlamydia-specific antibody levels. This information can be used to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic treatment and potentially susceptibility to reinfection."
0,"Patient-derived and mouse endo-ectocervical organoid generation, genetic manipulation and applications to model infection",10.1038/s41596-022-00695-6,"The cervix is the gateway to the upper female reproductive tract, connecting the uterus and vagina. It plays crucial roles in fertility and pregnancy maintenance from onset until delivery of the fetus, and prevents pathogen ascension. Compromised functionality of the cervix can lead to disorders, including infertility, chronic infections and cancers. The cervix comprises two regions: columnar epithelium-lined endocervix and stratified squamous epithelium-lined ectocervix, meeting at the squamocolumnar transition zone. So far, two-dimensional cultures of genetically unstable immortalized or cancer cell lines have been primarily used to study cervix biology in vitro. The lack of an in vitro system that reflects the cellular, physiological and functional properties of the two epithelial types has hampered the study of normal physiology, disease development and infection processes. Here we describe a protocol for cell isolation, establishment, long-term culture and expansion of adult epithelial stem cell-derived endocervical and ectocervical organoids from human biopsies and mouse tissue. These two organoid types require unique combinations of growth factors reminiscent of their in vivo tissue niches and different culturing procedures. They recapitulate native three-dimensional tissue architecture and patterning. The protocol to generate these organoids takes 4-6 weeks. We also describe procedures to introduce human papillomavirus oncogenes into the cervical stem cells by genetic manipulation to model cervical cancer and infection of the organoids with the highly prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis. These organoid systems open new possibilities to study cervix biology, infections and cancer evolution, and have potential applications in personalized medicine, drug screening, genome editing and disease modeling."
0,The p47phox deficiency significantly attenuates the pathogenicity of Chlamydia muridarum in the mouse oviduct but not uterine tissues,10.1016/j.micinf.2015.11.003,"The Chlamydia muridarum induction of the upper genital tract pathology in mice has been used to investigate the mechanisms of chlamydial pathogenesis. We report that the NCF1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor1)-encoded p47phox (phagocyte oxidase), an essential subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase, contributes significantly to C. muridarum induction of hydrosalpinx. Mice lacking p47phox (p47phox-deficient) were no longer able to develop significant hydrosalpinx following an intravaginal infection with C. muridarum. However, there was no significant difference in uterine horn dilation (as a result of the endometrial glandular duct dilation) between the p47phox-deficient and -sufficient mice. Thus, the role of NADPH oxidase in chlamydial pathogenesis is restricted to the oviduct tissue rather than the entire upper genital tract. Interestingly, both the p47phox-deficient and -sufficient mice displayed similar levels of chlamydial live organism shedding from the lower genital tract, suggesting that the NADPH oxidase is not required for the mouse control of chlamydial infection in the lower genital tract. Furthermore, the p47phox deficiency did not affect the infectious organism burden in the upper genital tract tissues, indicating that the NADPH-oxidase activity is not necessary for the mouse prevention of chlamydial ascension from the lower to upper genital tracts. However, the p47phox-defieicnt mice displayed a significantly reduced chronic inflammatory infiltration in the oviduct but not uterine tissues, supporting the finding that the NADPH oxidase activity is required for chlamydial induction of dilation in the oviduct but not the endometrial glandular duct. Thus, we have demonstrated a significant role of the host NADPH oxidase in promoting chronic inflammatory pathology in the oviduct following chlamydial infection."

The results obtained with the Cobas assay were compared with the patient infected status derived from a combination of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved nucleic acid amplification tests to determine the sensitivity and specificity of detection from each sample type. The sensitivity of Cobas for the detection of C. trachomatis in female specimens was 95.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.4% to 97.4%) for urine; 98.6% (95% CI, 95.2% to 99.6%) and 99.2% (95% CI, 95.4% to 99.9%) for clinician- and self-collected vaginal swab specimens, respectively; 93.3% (95% CI, 89.6% to 95.7%) for endocervical swabs; and 92.5% (95% CI, 88.7% to 95.1%) for cervical swab samples in PreservCyt. The specificity for the detection of C. trachomatis was ≥98.8% for all female sample types. Sensitivity and specificity estimates of Cobas for the detection of C. trachomatis in male urine samples were 100% (96.8% to 100.0%) and 99.7% (95% CI, 99.2% to 99.9%), respectively. The sensitivity of Cobas for the detection of N. gonorrhoeae in female specimens was 94.8% (95% CI, 89.6% to 97.4%) for urine; 100.0% (95% CI, 87.9% to 100.0%) and 100.0% (95% CI, 87.9% to 100.0%) for clinician- and self-collected vaginal swab specimens, respectively; 97.0% (95% CI, 91.5% to 99.0%) for endocervical swabs; and 96.6% (95% CI, 90.6% to 98.8%) for cervical samples in PreservCyt; the specificity for all female sample types was >99.0%. The sensitivity and specificity of Cobas for detecting N. gonorrhoeae in male urine were 100.0% (95% CI, 95.8% to 100.0%) and 99.5% (95% CI, 98.8% to 99.8%), respectively. Fully automated assays help fill the clinical need for a sensitive, high-throughput screening tool to aid public health efforts to control C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections."

The increasing resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacteria  responsible for causing gonorrhea, to commonly used antimicrobial drugs, is a  major concern. This has now become a critical global health crisis. In the coming  years, there is a risk of a hidden epidemic caused by the emergence of gonococcal  AMR. This will worsen the global situation. Infections caused by N. gonorrhoeae  were once considered easily treatable. However, over time, they have become  increasingly resistant to commonly used therapeutic medications, such as  penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and azithromycin. As a result, this pathogen is  developing into a true ""superbug,"" which means that ceftriaxone is now the only  available option for initial empirical treatment. Effective management strategies  are urgently needed to prevent severe consequences, such as infertility and  pelvic inflammatory disease, which can result from delayed intervention. This  review provides a thorough analysis of the escalating problem of N. gonorrhoeae,  including its pathogenesis, current treatment options, the emergence of  drug-resistant mechanisms, and the potential for vaccine development. We aim to  provide valuable insights for healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and  researchers in their efforts to combat N. gonorrhoeae antibiotic resistance by  elucidating the multifaceted aspects of this global challenge."

0,[SOME DIAGNOSTIC ASPECTS OF CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS UROGENITAL INFECTIONS],,"The following tests were used to make the diagnosis of Chlamydia Trachomatis: Ensime Immunoassay (EIA), Enzyme-Linked FluorescentAssay (ELFA), Polymerase Chain Reaction DNA amplification for Chlamydia Trachomatis, Neisseria Gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma Genitalium and Ureaplasma Urealyticum. The subject of this study were 486 outpatients between the ages of 17 and 62, diagnosed with urethritis, epidydimitis, prostatitis, cervicitis, endocervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease and sterility. Comparison PCR and EIA showed statistically significant difference between the positive results obtained by the two methods (p<0.001). Comparing PCR and ELFA on the other hand, did not show any statistically significant difference (p>0.1). EIA is the method that gives a higher percentage of nonspecific positive reactions, while the results obtained with ELFA are much closer to the ones obtained by PCR. According to contemporary evidence based medicine, the development of unified standart methods for diagnosis and evaluation is of vital importance, not only for the patient and the treating physician but also concerns for the healthcare system, the general public and the pharmaceutical companies as well."
0,Defining characteristics of genital health in South African adolescent girls and young women at high risk for HIV infection,10.1371/journal.pone.0213975,"The genital tract of African women has been shown to differ from what is currently accepted as 'normal', defined by a pH≤4.5 and lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) from sub-Saharan Africa are at high risk for HIV, and we hypothesized that specific biological factors are likely to be influential. This study aimed to compare characteristics of vaginal health in HIV-negative AGYW (16-22-years-old), from two South African communities, to international norms. We measured plasma hormones, vaginal pH, presence of BV (Nugent scoring), sexually transmitted infections (multiplex PCR for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoea, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium) and candidiasis (Gram stain) in AGYW (n = 298) from Cape Town and Soweto. Cervicovaginal microbiota was determined by 16S pyrosequencing; 44 genital cytokines were measured by Luminex; and cervical T-cell activation/proliferation (CCR5, HLA-DR, CD38, Ki67) was measured by multiparametric flow cytometry. 90/298 (30.2%) AGYW were negative for BV, candidiasis and bacterial STIs. L. crispatus and L. iners were the dominant bacteria in cervicovaginal swabs, and the median vaginal pH was 4.7. AGYW with L. crispatus-dominant microbiota (42.4%) generally had the lowest cytokine concentrations compared to women with more diverse microbiota (34/44 significantly upregulated cytokines). Frequencies of CCR5+CD4+ T-cells co-expressing CD38 and HLA-DR correlated positively with interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-α, GRO-α, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, and IL-9. While endogenous oestrogen had an immune-dampening effect on IL-6, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and IL-16, injectable hormone contraceptives (DMPA and Net-EN) were associated with significantly lower endogenous hormone concentrations (p<0.0001 for oestrogen and progesterone) and upregulation of 34/44 cytokines. Since genital inflammation and the presence of activated CD4+ T cells in the genital tract have been implicated in increased HIV risk in South African women, the observed high levels of genital cellular activation and cytokines from AGYW may point towards biological factors increasing HIV risk in this region."
0,Update on Treatment Options for Gonococcal Infections,10.1002/phar.1627,"The incidence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in the United States has grown over the past decade. The most recent data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that reported cases have increased by almost 10% over the last 5 years. In conjunction with this rise, the presence of multidrug-resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae has also emerged. The 2015 CDC guidelines recommend dual therapy with intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin as first-line treatment, although components of this regimen are met with a high level of resistance. Although ceftriaxone resistance has not yet been reported in the United States, it is only a matter of time before such isolates are detected, thus ushering in a new era of difficult-to-manage uncomplicated gonococcal infection. The potential public health crisis and patient-associated sequelae (e.g., pelvic inflammatory disease, epididymitis, and human immunodeficiency virus infection) linked with untreatable gonorrhea are cause for great concern. To try to stem this tide, a number of new agents targeted against N. gonorrhoeae are being investigated in clinical trials. In this article, we review the various agents, both currently available and under clinical investigation, and provide recommendations for the management of gonococcal infections."
0,Association of human papillomavirus and Chlamydia trachomatis with intraepithelial alterations in cervix samples,10.1590/0074-02760150330,"The influence of different infectious agents and their association with human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinogenesis have not been completely elucidated. This study describes the association between cytological changes in cervical epithelium and the detection of the most relevant aetiological agents of sexually transmitted diseases. Samples collected from 169 patients were evaluated by conventional cytology followed by molecular analysis to detect HPV DNA, Chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2,Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis, andTreponema pallidum, besides genotyping for most common high-risk HPV. An association between cytological lesions and different behavioural habits such as smoking and sedentariness was observed. Intraepithelial lesions were also associated with HPV and C. trachomatis detection. An association was also found between both simple and multiple genotype infection and cytological changes. The investigation of HPV and C. trachomatisproved its importance and may be considered in the future for including in screening programs, since these factors are linked to the early diagnosis of patients with precursor lesions of cervical cancer."
0,Role of Lactobacilli and Lactoferrin in the Mucosal Cervicovaginal Defense,10.3389/fimmu.2018.00376,"The innate defense system of the female mucosal genital tract involves a close and complex interaction among the healthy vaginal microbiota, different cells, and various proteins that protect the host from pathogens. Vaginal lactobacilli and lactoferrin represent two essential actors in the vaginal environment. Lactobacilli represent the dominant bacterial species able to prevent facultative and obligate anaerobes outnumber in vaginal microbiota maintaining healthy microbial homeostasis. Several mechanisms underlie the protection exerted by lactobacilli: competition for nutrients and tissue adherence, reduction of the vaginal pH, modulation of immunity, and production of bioactive compounds. Among bioactive factors of cervicovaginal mucosa, lactoferrin, an iron-binding cationic glycoprotein, is a multifunctional glycoprotein with antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic activities, recently emerging as an important modulator of inflammation. Lactobacilli and lactoferrin are largely under the influence of female hormones and of paracrine production of various cytokines. Lactoferrin is strongly increased in lower genital tract mucosal fluid of women affected by Neisseria gonorrheae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis infections promoting both innate and adaptive immune responses. In vaginal dysbiosis characterized by low amounts of vaginal lactobacilli and increased levels of endogenous anaerobic bacteria, the increase in lactoferrin could act as an immune modulator assuming the role normally played by the healthy microbiota in vaginal mucosa. Then lactoferrin and lactobacilli may be considered as biomarkers of altered microbial homeostasis at vaginal level. Considering the shortage of effective treatments to counteract recurrent and/or antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, the intravaginal administration of lactobacilli and lactoferrin could be a novel efficient therapeutic strategy and a valuable tool to restore mucosal immune homeostasis."
0,The Lst Sialyltransferase of Neisseria gonorrhoeae Can Transfer Keto-Deoxyoctanoate as the Terminal Sugar of Lipooligosaccharide: a Glyco-Achilles Heel That Provides a New Strategy for Vaccines to Prevent Gonorrhea,10.1128/mBio.03666-20,"The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae plays key roles in pathogenesis and is composed of multiple possible glycoforms. These glycoforms are generated by the process of phase variation and by differences in the glycosyltransferase gene content of particular strains. LOS glycoforms of N. gonorrhoeae can be terminated with an N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), which imparts resistance to the bactericidal activity of serum. However, N. gonorrhoeae cannot synthesize the CMP-Neu5Ac required for LOS biosynthesis and must acquire it from the host. In contrast, Neisseria meningitidis can synthesize endogenous CMP-Neu5Ac, the donor molecule for Neu5Ac, which is a component of some meningococcal capsule structures. Both species have an almost identical LOS sialyltransferase, Lst, that transfers Neu5Ac from CMP-Neu5Ac to the terminus of LOS. Lst is homologous to the LsgB sialyltransferase of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Studies in NTHi have demonstrated that LsgB can transfer keto-deoxyoctanoate (KDO) from CMP-KDO to the terminus of LOS in place of Neu5Ac. Here, we show that Lst can also transfer KDO to LOS in place of Neu5Ac in both N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis Consistent with access to the pool of CMP-KDO in the cytoplasm, we present data indicating that Lst is localized in the cytoplasm. Lst has previously been reported to be localized on the outer membrane. We also demonstrate that KDO is expressed as a terminal LOS structure in vivo in samples from infected women and further show that the anti-KDO monoclonal antibody 6E4 can mediate opsonophagocytic killing of N. gonorrhoeae Taken together, these studies indicate that KDO expressed on gonococcal LOS represents a new antigen for the development of vaccines against gonorrhea.IMPORTANCE The emergence of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains that are resistant to available antimicrobials is a current health emergency, and no vaccine is available to prevent gonococcal infection. Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is one of the major virulence factors of N. gonorrhoeae The sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) is present as the terminal glycan on LOS in N. gonorrhoeae In this study, we made an unexpected discovery that KDO can be incorporated as the terminal glycan on LOS of N. gonorrhoeae by the alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase Lst. We showed that N. gonorrhoeae express KDO on LOS in vivo and that the KDO-specific monoclonal antibody 6E4 can direct opsonophagocytic killing of N. gonorrhoeae These data support further development of KDO-LOS structures as vaccine antigens for the prevention of infection by N. gonorrhoeae."
1,A chlamydia education and training program for general practice nurses: reporting the effect on chlamydia testing uptake,10.1071/PY20056,"The long-term health consequences of untreated chlamydia are an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies and infertility among women. To support increased chlamydia testing, and as part of a randomised controlled trial of a chlamydia intervention in general practice, a chlamydia education and training program for general practice nurses (GPN) was developed. The training aimed to increase GPNs' chlamydia knowledge and management skills. We compared the difference in chlamydia testing between general practices where GPNs received training to those who didn't and evaluated acceptability. Testing rates increased in all general practices over time. Where GPNs had training, chlamydia testing rates increased (from 8.3% to 19.9% (difference=11.6%; 95% CI 9.4-13.8)) and where GPNs did not have training (from 7.4% to 18.0% (difference=10.6%; 95% CI 7.6-13.6)). By year 2, significantly higher testing rates were seen in practices where GPNs had training (treatment effect=4.9% (1.1 - 8.7)), but this difference was not maintained in year 3 (treatment effect=1.2% (-2.5 - 4.9)). Results suggest a GPN chlamydia education and training program can increase chlamydia testing up to 2 years; however, further training is required to sustain the increase beyond that time."

A strain-specific 16S rRNA gene of Ureaplasma diversum was used for detection which was cloned, sequenced, and characterized earlier. LAMP results were visualized within 90 min with the naked eye. Cervico-vaginal swabs of 50 buffaloes were randomly collected from Livestock Research Center of NDRI as per the Institute Animal ethics guidelines. Out of 50 cervico-vaginal swab samples collected randomly, 34 were found positive with LAMP while 16 samples were negative. Conventional PCR results showed the same result. Therefore, the accuracy of the developed LAMP was about 100%. The developed LAMP assay can also be used to screen the animals for Ureaplasma diversum infection in cervico-vaginal swab. However, further study is needed to assess sensitivity and accuracy towards their detection and their relationship in disease diagnosis."
0,The Cervicovaginal Microbiota-Host Interaction Modulates Chlamydia trachomatis Infection,10.1128/mBio.01548-19,"The mechanism(s) by which Lactobacillus-dominated cervicovaginal microbiota provide a barrier to Chlamydia trachomatis infection remain(s) unknown. Here we evaluate the impact of different Lactobacillus spp. identified via culture-independent metataxonomic analysis of C. trachomatis-infected women on C. trachomatis infection in a three-dimensional (3D) cervical epithelium model. Lactobacillus spp. that specifically produce d(-) lactic acid were associated with long-term protection against C. trachomatis infection, consistent with reduced protection associated with Lactobacillus iners, which does not produce this isoform, and with decreased epithelial cell proliferation, consistent with the observed prolonged protective effect. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that epigenetic modifications involving histone deacetylase-controlled pathways are integral to the cross talk between host and microbiota. These results highlight a fundamental mechanism whereby the cervicovaginal microbiota modulates host functions to protect against C. trachomatis infection.IMPORTANCE The vaginal microbiota is believed to protect women against Chlamydia trachomatis, the etiologic agent of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI) in developed countries. The mechanism underlying this protection has remained elusive. Here, we reveal the comprehensive strategy by which the cervicovaginal microbiota modulates host functions to protect against chlamydial infection, thereby providing a novel conceptual mechanistic understanding. Major implications of this work are that (i) the impact of the vaginal microbiota on the epithelium should be considered in future studies of chlamydial infection and other STIs and (ii) a fundamental understanding of the cervicovaginal microbiota's role in protection against STIs may enable the development of novel microbiome-based therapeutic strategies to protect women from infection and improve vaginal and cervical health."

It also evaluates the demographic information, symptoms, and sequelae. Endocervical samples were obtained over a period of eight months from 360 women including 180 symptomatic patients and 180 patients with pregnancy-related complications and infertility. CT, NG, and TV were detected in 10.8%, 6.9%, and 8.3% of all patients, respectively. The prevalence of CT, NG, and TV among women in the symptomatic group was 11.1%, 7.2%, and 13.3%, respectively, and among women with pregnancy-related complications and infertility was 10.6%, 6.7%, and 3.3%, respectively. Associations between chlamydia and ectopic pregnancy (p = 0.001), and infertility (p < 0.001) were observed. Abortion (p = 0.008), infertility (p = 0.005), and ectopic pregnancy (p < 0.001) were associated with gonorrhea. Abnormal vaginal discharge (p = 0.02) and vulvar itching (p = 0.02) were associated with trichomoniasis. Overall, the prevalence rates of CT, NG, and TV were high in these patient groups. These high prevalences suggest that screening programs are required to reduce the burden of these sexually transmitted infections and their effects on genitourinary symptoms, pregnancy-related complications, and infertility."

Only 11.4% of 299 women were tested for MG despite 74.2% being tested for Chlamydia trichomonas (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG). Only 9% of the women were treated with antibiotics which would treat macrolide-sensitive MG infection. Increasing education and awareness of MG and utilising reflex macrolide testing for MG will help direct effective antibiotic therapy and prevent the long-term sequalae of PID.
1,Screening Pelvic Examinations in Asymptomatic Average Risk Adult Women,,"The routine pelvic examination has been a usual part of preventive care for women for many decades. In 2008, 63.4 million pelvic examinations were performed in the United States. Many women and providers believe that the routine pelvic exam should be included in an annual comprehensive well-woman visit. The exam consists of inspection of the external genitalia, speculum examination of the vagina and cervix, bimanual examination, and sometimes rectal or rectovaginal examination. Traditionally, the examination in the asymptomatic average risk women has been used to screen for pathology through palpation, visualization, and specimen collection. Pathology potentially detectable on the pelvic examination includes malignancies (e.g., cervical, ovarian, uterine, bladder, vaginal or vulvar); infections (e.g., Chlamydia, gonorrhea, warts, candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis); pelvic inflammatory disease (PID); or other pathology (e.g., atrophic vaginitis, cervical polyps, uterine prolapse, fibroids). In addition, pelvic examinations are often performed prior to the provision of hormonal contraception. Recent high quality evidence-based reviews and guidelines have concluded that pelvic examinations are not required for Chlamydia and gonorrhea screening or for hormonal contraception initiation and up-to-date evidence-based guidelines for cervical cancer screening are also available. However, we are unaware of any systematic reviews that have investigated the utility of the pelvic examination for the other indications. This systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the benefits and harms of the routine screening pelvic examination in asymptomatic, average risk, non-pregnant, adult women. For cervical cancer and sexually transmitted infection (i.e., Chlamydia and gonorrhea) screening and for initiation of hormonal contraception we summarize the results of recent reviews and guidelines from major US health organizations. For all other indications, we performed and report results from a comprehensive search of the medical literature."
0,"Role of the Gonococcal Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen in Microcolony Formation, and Serum Resistance and Adherence to Epithelial Cells",10.1093/infdis/jiz628,"The sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea is on the rise worldwide and an increased understanding of the mechanisms of colonization and pathogenesis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is required to aid development of new treatment and prevention strategies. In the current study, we investigate the neisserial heparin-binding antigen (NHBA) of N. gonorrhoeae and confirm its role in binding to several glycans, including heparin, and identify interactions of NHBA with both gonococcal and host cells. Furthermore, we report that a gonococcal nhba mutant displays decreased cell aggregation and microcolony formation, as well as reduced survival in human serum and reduced adherence to human cervical and urethral epithelial cells, relative to the wild-type strain. These data indicate that the gonococcal NHBA contributes to several aspects of the colonization and survival of N. gonorrhoeae and may be a target for new antimicrobial or vaccines."
0,A Population-Specific Optimized GeneXpert Pooling Algorithm for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae To Reduce Cost of Molecular Sexually Transmitted Infection Screening in Resource-Limited Settings,10.1128/JCM.00176-20,"The sexually transmitted infections (STIs) chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (NG) are often asymptomatic in women and undetected by syndromic management, leading to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Molecular testing, such as the GeneXpert CT/NG assay, is highly sensitive, but cost restraints preclude implementation of these technologies in resource-limited settings. Pooled testing is one strategy to reduce the cost per sample, but the extent of savings depends on disease prevalence. The current study describes a pooling strategy based on identification of sociodemographic and laboratory factors associated with CT/NG prevalence in a high-risk cohort of Zambian female sex workers and single mothers conducted from 2016 to 2019. Factors associated with testing positive for CT/NG via logistic regression modeling included city, younger age, lower education, long-acting reversible contraception usage, Trichomonas vaginalis infection, bacterial vaginosis, and incident syphilis infection. Based on these factors, the study population was stratified into high-, intermediate-, and low-prevalence subgroups and tested accordingly-individually, pools of 3, or pools of 4, respectively. The cost per sample was reduced from $18 to as low as $9.43 in the low-prevalence subgroup. The checklist tool and pooling approach described can be used in a variety of treatment algorithms to lower the cost per sample and increase access to molecular STI screening. This is particularly valuable in resource-limited settings to detect and treat asymptomatic CT/NG infections missed by traditional syndromic management."

1,"Intrauterine Devices in the Context of Gonococcal Infection, Chlamydial Infection, and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: Not Mutually Exclusive",10.1111/jmwh.13120,"The use of long-acting reversible contraception, namely, intrauterine device (IUDs) and the subdermal implant, has been recommended to address the high rate of the unintended pregnancy in the United States. IUDs are a safe, highly effective contraceptive method, suitable for most women. The underutilization of IUDs arises in part from the lack of translation of best practices in the clinical setting as well as fears and misperceptions about this contraceptive method held by health care providers and women. This article reviews screening and management of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infection and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women who are using or want to use an IUD. An IUD may be inserted without prior screening for N gonorrhoeae or C trachomatis in women who are at low risk for sexually transmitted infections and asymptomatic. An in situ IUD may remain in the uterus during and after treatment for gonococcal infection, chlamydial infection, or PID. The risk of PID with an IUD in situ is less than 1%. Following IUD best practices, including their use in the context of sexually transmitted infections, can increase the availability of this method for suitable candidates and decrease the unintended pregnancy rate."

1,Biological feasibility and importance of a gonorrhea vaccine for global public health,10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.02.081,"There is a growing public health interest in controlling sexually transmitted infections (STIs) through vaccination due to increasing recognition of the global disease burden of STIs and the role of STIs in women's reproductive health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and the health and well-being of neonates. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has historically challenged vaccine development through the expression of phase and antigenically variable surface molecules and its capacity to cause repeated infections without inducing protective immunity. An estimated 78 million new N. gonorrhoeae infections occur annually and the greatest disease burden is carried by low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Current control measures are clearly inadequate and threatened by the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance. The gonococcus now holds the status of ""super-bug"" as there is currently no single reliable monotherapy for empirical treatment of gonorrhea. The problem of antibiotic resistance has elevated treatment costs and necessitated the establishment of large surveillance programs to track the spread of resistant strains. Here we review the need for a gonorrhea vaccine with respect to global disease burden and related socioeconomic and treatment costs, with an emphasis on the impact of gonorrhea on women and newborns. We also highlight the challenge of estimating the impact of a gonorrhea vaccine due to the need for more data on the burden of gonococcal pelvic inflammatory disease and related sequelae and of gonorrhea-associated adverse pregnancy outcomes and the problem of empirical diagnosis and treatment of STIs in LMIC. There is also a lack of clinical and basic science research in the area of gonococcal/chlamydia coinfection, which occurs in a high percentage of individuals with gonorrhea and should be considered when testing the efficacy of gonorrhea vaccines. Finally, we review recent research that suggests a gonorrhea vaccine is feasible and discuss challenges and research gaps in gonorrhea vaccine development."

All women should be screened with a history and pelvic examination before IUD insertion, but only high-risk women need a laboratory test; this includes women aged 25 years or younger with no test within the last year, and women with additional behavioral risk factors. If testing is indicated, it should be done on the same day as insertion not a separate visit. Women with positive test results should be treated as soon as results are available."

A total of 714 subjects who had undergone cervical Pap smears and concomitant analyses for cervical infections were included by a retrospective search. The frequencies of reactive cellular change (RCC) and squamous epithelial abnormalities were significantly higher in Chlamydia positive subjects than in uninfected subjects (P<0.001). Of the 124 subjects tested for M. hominis, M. genitalium, and U. urealyticum, 14 (11%) were positive for M. hominis and 29 (23%) were positive for U. urealyticum. Squamous abnormalities were more frequent in subjects with Ureaplasma infections than in uninfected subjects (24% versus 8%). Taking together these findings, C. trachomatis and U. urealyticum may have a causal role in the development of cervical epithelial changes, including RCC. Thus, extra awareness is warranted in cervical screening of women with Chlamydia or Ureaplasma infections."
0,Correlation between Seropositivity of Chlamydia Trachomatis and Tubal and/or Pelvic Pathology Detected by Diagnostic Laparoscopy in Subfertile Women,,"This prospective observational study was carried out in the Infertility Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, from February 2011 to December 2013. Sixty-nine (69) subfertile women who were seropositive for Chlamydia Trachomatis were included in this study. Inclusion criteria was patients with sub-fertility having age between 22 and 40 years, seeking infertility treatment, normal ovarian function, all normozoospermic male partner, duration of infertility ranged from 1.5 to 14 years. Exclusion criteria were patients having sub-fertility with extensive pelvic and/or ovarian surgery, endometriosis, ablation of endometriotic spots, pelvic tuberculosis and history of ectopic pregnancy. Before laparoscopic evaluation, all study women were screened for Chlamydia Trachomatis Specific IgG & IgM antibodies using ELISA in the Microbiology Department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. All the study women had positive results for IgG antibodies. All study women underwent diagnostic laparoscopy. During laparoscopy, we observed the condition of pelvic cavity, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, peritubal adhesions, tubo-ovarian relationship, status of Pouch of Douglas (POD), fimbriae etc. During dye test procedure, dilute methylene blue dye was injected through the cervical canal and the dye spill out was observed to confirm the tubal patency or blockage or pattern of flow of dye. The results of laparoscopic findings demonstrated that mobility of uterus was restricted in 20(29%) cases, adhesion of uterus with peritoneum was in 8(11.6%) cases, uterine fibroid was present in 11(15.9%) cases, hydrosalpinx in right fallopian tubes were in 27(39.1%) cases, in left fallopian tubes were in 32(46.4%) cases and in both fallopian tubes in 16(23.2%) cases, inflamed right fallopian tubes in 32(46.4%) cases, inflamed left fallopian tubes in 36(52.2%) cases and inflamed both fallopian tubes in 26(37.7%) cases, adhesions in pouch of Douglas was in 4(5.8%) cases, collections in pouch of Douglas was in 7(10.1%) cases and obliterations in pouch of Douglas was in 5(7.2%) cases. Results of Dye test during laparoscopy were that right fallopian tube was blocked in 32(46.4%) cases, left fallopian tube was blocked in 32(46.4%) cases and both fallopian tubes were blocked in 21(30.4%) cases. This study shows that by laparoscopy, significant number of cases of tubal and pelvic pathology was diagnosed in the chlamydia trachomatis seropositive subfertile female. This indicates strong correlation between seropositivity of chlamydia trachomatis and/or pelvic pathology detected by diagnostic laparoscopy."
1,Women's experiences of pelvic inflammatory disease: implications for health-care professionals,10.1177/1359105313476973,"This study explored the health-care experiences of women diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 women diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease. Many women felt empowered about their health post-diagnosis; however, a smaller number reported becoming hyper-vigilant towards symptoms. Infertility was the greatest concern for women. Inadequate information and treatment resulted in negative health experiences, whereas clinician honesty and concern were viewed positively. The findings highlight the need for community education encouraging early presentation for the treatment of pelvic pain and emphasise the need for health practitioners to be responsive to the psychosocial aspects of pelvic inflammatory disease."
1,Bacteriological agents which play a role in the development of infertility,10.1556/AMicr.60.2013.1.5,"This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of the bacterial agents Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae), Mycoplasma hominis (M. hominis) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (U. urealyticum) and the conditions which may play a role in the development of female infertility, in the county of Iaşi in North-Eastern Romania. Cervical and blood samples were collected from 176 infertile women and 45 pregnant women in the third trimester. Classical methods and real time PCR were applied to each cervical sample to detect the presence of these sexually transmitted microorganisms; the ELISA method was applied to blood samples to detect C. trachomatis antibodies (IgA, IgM and IgG). The proportion of C. trachomatis IgG was significantly higher in the infertile group (23.8%) than in the pregnant group (4.4%), p < 0.05. For C. trachomatis antigen (Ag) and N. gonorrhoeae Ag no differences were observed between the two groups. The prevalence of mycoplasma genital infections was higher in the pregnant group (U. urealyticum - 53.3% and M. hominis - 20%) than in the infertile group (U. urealyticum - 39.7% and M. hominis - 7.3%). Higher rate of co-infection with C. trachomatis and mycoplasma were observed among the infertile women (25.7%) than among the pregnant women (7.7%). This combination could be involved in the appearance of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and its sequela, including infertility. C. trachomatis IgG determination still remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of PID and should be used as a screening test for the prediction of tubal damage in infertile women. In view of the large number of cases involving the co-existence of genital infections with C. trachomatis, M. hominis and U. urealyticum, it is clearly necessary to perform screening for all three microorganisms among all women of reproductive age but especially those who are infertile."
0,Isolation of Mycoplasma genitalium from endocervical swabs of infertile women,10.15537/smj.2017.5.18820,To determine the occurrence of Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) infection in infertile women attending infertility clinic and its association to infertility. Methods: Endocervical specimens were collected from women presenting with primary and secondary infertility and from fertile women as control group. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  assay was performed to detect the presence of M. genitalium from these endocervical specimens.  Results: Mycoplasma genitalium was detected in 3% of infertile women. There was no statistically significant difference between infertility and control group as to signs and symptoms except for signs of cervicitis were presented only among infertile group. We found no significant differences among fertile and infertile women for M. genitalium infection. Conclusion: An association between M. genitalium infection and infertility may exist. Screening of women for M. genitalium infection is recommended as part of investigations for infertility.

By ICT and/or PCR, the C. trachomatis detection rate was 58% and 27% in FSW and SAW, respectively, showing a significant difference (P < 0.01). Two C. trachomatis strains from FSW were determined to be serovar D by ompA-based PCR and sequencing analysis. The highest prevalence was found among women aged 15 to 35 years. A lower socioeconomic status was considered to be an important risk factor for C. trachomatis infection in FSW but not in SAW.

0,Fetal fibronectin detection for preterm birth prediction,10.4238/2014.February.28.4,"To study preterm birth prediction based on fetal fibronectin (fFN) in pregnant women, we randomly selected 124 patients. Vaginal posterior fornix secretions were analyzed using fFN quick test strips. Leucorrhea routine samples were collected to detect bacterial vaginosis, mycoplasma, and chlamydia. Delivery data at 7 days, 14 days, 34 weeks, and 37 weeks were documented and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were analyzed. Of the 124 cases, we found 2, 4, 10, and 18 cases of maternity within 7 days, 14 days, 34 weeks, and 37 weeks, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were as follows: 100, 77.8, 6.9, and 100% for 7 days; 75, 78.3, 10.3, and 98.9% for 14 days; 50.0, 78.9, 17.2, and 94.7% for 34 weeks; 33.3, 78.3, 20.7, and 87.4% for 37 weeks, respectively. Except for 18 preterm births, 23 cases were fFN-positive, 17 cases had lower genital tract infection. Eighty-three cases were fFN-negative, of which 18 cases had the lower genital tract infections. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Eighteen cases (14.5% of the pregnant women) had preterm birth. Ten cases delivered within 34 weeks. The negative predictive value and recent predictive value of fFN testing were higher; the positive predictive value was limited due to the impact of lower genital tract infection. The fFN-positive patients need timely clinical processing. During the pregnancy, monitoring of fFN changes and early detection of abnormalities help to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality."
0,How robust are the natural history parameters used in chlamydia transmission dynamic models? A systematic review,10.1186/1742-4682-11-8,"Transmission dynamic models linked to economic analyses often form part of the decision making process when introducing new chlamydia screening interventions. Outputs from these transmission dynamic models can vary depending on the values of the parameters used to describe the infection. Therefore these values can have an important influence on policy and resource allocation. The risk of progression from infection to pelvic inflammatory disease has been extensively studied but the parameters which govern the transmission dynamics are frequently neglected. We conducted a systematic review of transmission dynamic models linked to economic analyses of chlamydia screening interventions to critically assess the source and variability of the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic, the duration of infection and the transmission probability. We identified nine relevant studies in Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane database. We found that there is a wide variation in their natural history parameters, including an absolute difference in the proportion of asymptomatic infections of 25% in women and 75% in men, a six-fold difference in the duration of asymptomatic infection and a four-fold difference in the per act transmission probability. We consider that much of this variation can be explained by a lack of consensus in the literature. We found that a significant proportion of parameter values were referenced back to the early chlamydia literature, before the introduction of nucleic acid modes of diagnosis and the widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals. In conclusion, authors should use high quality contemporary evidence to inform their parameter values, clearly document their assumptions and make appropriate use of sensitivity analysis. This will help to make models more transparent and increase their utility to policy makers."

Adverse infection outcomes include pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, preterm delivery, and congenital or neonatal infection. Highly sensitive molecular diagnostic testing for genital tract infections is now recommended in many countries. Unfortunately, this testing is not yet widely available in low- and middle-income countries because of cost.

0,How to Identify Exposed Women Who Are Infected with Neisseria gonorrhoeae,10.1007/978-1-4939-9496-0_2,"Treatment trials of antibiotics for Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections frequently enroll primarily men with urethritis, as the diagnosis of acute gonococcal infection in men with urethritis is easily made by Gram stain of the urethral exudate, followed by confirmatory culture or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Enrolling women in treatment trials is of great importance, but N. gonorrhoeae cervical infections cause nonspecific symptoms. This makes it difficult to conduct interventional trials, as large numbers of women with nonspecific symptoms need to be screened for infection. Gram stain of cervical secretions has a strikingly low sensitivity, and culture and/or NAAT results are not available at the time of screening. This necessitates recall and delayed treatment of infected women who may not return and who may spread the infection during the interval. In this chapter we present an algorithm, derived from a comparison of women who did, or did not, become infected during exposure, which identifies those women who are highly likely to be infected before culture and/or NAAT results are available. The algorithm provides an efficient way to conduct interventional trials in women without the problem of recall and delayed treatment."

Two overlapping groups of women with cervicitis were considered: 'cervicitis group 1' (n = 116) excluded women with Trichomonas vaginalis and a subgroup of this, 'cervicitis group 2' (non-specific cervicitis) (n = 96) further excluded women with Neisseria gonorrhoea, Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium at enrolment. Testing for Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium and Trichomonas vaginalis was by PCR and Neisseria gonorrhoea by PCR and culture. Treatment outcomes were cervicitis or vaginal symptoms at follow-up. Effect on cervicitis at follow-up was also assessed after additional reported partner treatment. In 'cervicitis group 1' where prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium and/or Chlamydia trachomatis was 23/116 (19.8%), azithromycin reduced cervicitis at follow-up (RR = 0.62 (95% CI 0.39-0.97) p = 0.035), but there was no significant effect in non-specific cervicitis ('cervicitis group 2') (RR = 0.60 (95% CI 0.35-1.01) p = 0.056). Empiric treatment did not reduce vaginal symptoms at follow-up in either group. No effect of empiric partner treatment was seen. The conclusion was that empiric azithromycin treatment of cervicitis reduces cervicitis at follow-up in populations with high prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Mycoplasma genitalium. There are no benefits of empiric azithromycin for non-specific cervicitis or empiric partner treatment."

Annually, 7.4 million new infections are estimated in the United States, which is greater than combined new cases of Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Serious adverse reproductive health outcomes including pregnancy complications, pelvic inflammatory disease, and an increased risk of HIV acquisition have been linked to TV infection. There are several sensitive and specific diagnostic tests available, including a newly approved nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) that utilizes the same instrumentation platform and clinical sample as Chlamydia and gonorrhea tests. In this article, we review TV pathogenicity, adverse reproductive health outcomes, detection, and treatment followed by clinical scenarios for which TV diagnosis may prove useful in obstetrics and gynecology practice."

In this study, we show that the human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis infects the murine respiratory and genital mucosae and that T cells, but not Abs, elicited through intranasal immunization can protect against a subsequent transcervical challenge. Unlike the genital infection where CD8(+) T cells are primed, yet fail to confer protection, we found that intranasal priming engages both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, allowing for protection against genital infection with C. trachomatis. The protection is largely dependent on IFN-γ secretion by T cells. Moreover, different chemokine receptors are critical for C. trachomatis-specific CD4(+) T cells to home to the lung, rather than the CXCR3- and CCR5-dependent migration observed during genital infection. Overall, this study demonstrates that the cross-mucosa protective immunity against genital C. trachomatis infection following intranasal immunization is not dependent on Ab response but is mediated by not only CD4(+) T cells but also by CD8(+) T cells. This study provides insights for the development of vaccines against mucosal pathogens that threaten reproductive health worldwide."
0,"Inflammatory response elicited by Ureaplasma parvum colonization in human cervical epithelial, stromal, and immune cells",10.1530/REP-21-0308,"Ureaplasma parvum is a commensal bacterium in the female reproductive tract but has been associated with pregnancy complications such as preterm prelabor rupture of membranes and preterm birth (PTB). However, the pathologic effects of U. parvum in the cervix, which prevents ascending infections during pregnancy, are still poorly understood. To determine the impact of U. parvum on the cervix, ectocervical (ecto) and endocervical (endo) epithelial and stromal cells were incubated with U. parvum. Macrophages were also tested as a proxy for cervical macrophages to determine the antigenicity of U. parvum. The effects of U. parvum, including influence on cell cycle and cell death, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and inflammatory cytokine levels, were assessed. U. parvum colonized cervical epithelial and stromal cells 4 h post-infection. Like uninfected control, U. parvum neither inhibited cell cycle progression and nor caused cell death in cervical epithelial and stromal cells. U. parvum increased the production of the AMPs cathelicidin and human β-defensin 3 and exhibited weak signs of EMT evidenced by decreased cytokeratin 18 and increased vimentin expression in cervical epithelial cells. U. parvum induced a proinflammatory environment (cytokines) and increased MMP-9 in cervical epithelial cells but promoted pro- and anti-inflammatory response in cervical stromal cells and macrophages. U. parvum may colonize the cervical epithelial layer, but induction of AMPs and anti-inflammatory response may protect the cervix and may prevent ascending infections that can cause PTB. These findings suggest that U. parvum is a weak inducer of inflammation in the cervix."
0,"Infectious Vaginitis, Cervicitis, and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease.",10.1016/j.mcna.2022.10.009,"Vaginal symptoms are one of the most common reasons women consult with physicians and can significantly impact quality of life. The differential diagnosis of  vaginal discharge includes physiologic discharge, vaginitis, cervicitis, and  pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Vaginitis is inflammation of the vagina, most  commonly caused by bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis, and  trichomoniasis infections. Cervicitis is an inflammation of the cervix and  typically caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. PID is  infection of the female upper genital tract, involving the uterus, fallopian  tubes, ovaries, and/or pelvic peritoneum and usually caused by Chlamydia  trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens.  A pelvic exam should be performed for any woman presenting with vaginal discharge  to confirm the diagnosis and rule out an upper tract infection. BV and  vulvovaginal candidal infections only require treatment if symptomatic and do not  require partner therapy, whereas treatment and partner therapy is recommended for  sexually transmitted illnesses, such as trichomoniasis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.  Vaginitis may be uncomfortable, but rarely leads to serious long-term  consequence, but pelvic inflammatory disease can lead to serious long-term  sequelae, including increased risk for ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and  chronic pelvic pain."
1,Screening and treating Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease: interpretation of findings from randomized controlled trials,10.1097/OLQ.0b013e31827bd637,"We critically reviewed randomized controlled trials evaluating chlamydia screening to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and explored factors affecting interpretation and translation of trial data into public health prevention. Taken together, data from these trials offer evidence that chlamydia screening and treatment is an important and useful intervention to reduce the risk of PID among young women. However, the magnitude of benefit to be expected from screening may have been overestimated based on the earliest trials. It is likely that chlamydia screening programs have contributed to declines in PID incidence through shortening prevalent infections, although the magnitude of their contribution remains unclear. Program factors such as screening coverage as well as natural history factors such as risk of PID after repeat chlamydia infection can be important in determining the impact of chlamydia screening on PID incidence in a population. Uptake of chlamydia screening is currently suboptimal, and expansion of screening among young, sexually active women remains a priority. To reduce transmission and repeat infections, implementation of efficient strategies to treat partners of infected women is also essential. Results of ongoing randomized evaluations of the effect of screening on community-wide chlamydia prevalence and PID will also be valuable."
0,[Chlamydial infection with marked ascites that simulated ovarian cancer],,"We describe a case of genital chlamydial infection with marked ascites and an adnexal mass that simulated a malignant neoplasm. Laparotomy was performed. Multiple adhesions between visceral and peritoneum, enlarged retroperitoneal nodes were found. The right ovary contained a cystic mass. Examination of the peritoneal biopsies and ascites showed chronic lymphofollicular inflammation and chlamydial infection was suggested as the aetiology. The patient was treated with antibiotics and discharged from hospital in well-being. At follow-up examination four weeks later the patient had no symptoms."
0,Neisseria Gonorrhoeae Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis,10.1155/2021/8865339,"We describe a case of gonococcal spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in a 48-year-old sexually active female with alcoholic cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B. She was admitted with fever, abdominal pain and distension without dysuria, dyspareunia, or vaginal discharge. On exam, she was icteric with features of sepsis and tense ascites. She underwent paracentesis. The ascitic fluid analysis revealed a neutrophil count of 1,050/µL, and culture grew Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Pelvic examination findings were negative for pelvic inflammatory disease; however, an endocervical swab was positive for N. gonorrhoeae by PCR. She was diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis secondary to N. gonorrhoeae and was successfully treated with a seven-day course of IV ceftriaxone. N. gonorrhoeae spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an extremely rare entity reported only twice despite the high prevalence of gonorrhoeae in the general population. We hypothesize that gonococcal SBP may be frequently undiagnosed since it responds to empiric antibiotics used to treat SBP. It is important for the clinician to be aware of gonococcus as a rare but potential pathogen in SBP. Future studies are needed to determine if routine gonococcal screening in SBP cases would be of clinical utility."
0,[Usefulness of real-time PCR in detecting Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in endocervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens],,"We evaluated performance of Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay (real-time PCR, Abbott Japan) for detect Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae by real-time PCR in 88 female patients with cervicitis symptoms seen at gynecological clinics and 100 male patients with urethritis symptoms seen at urological or dermatology clinics in Kitakyushu, Japan. Endocervical swab and first-voided urine (FVU) specimens were then collected from women and FVU specimens from men. Detection rates of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by real-time PCR in the 3 types of specimens were compared to those by ProbeTec ET assay (ProbeTec, BD Diagnostic System). The overall positive concordance between real-time PCR and ProbTec were 97.1% (66/68) for C. trachomatis and 100% (33/33) for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis detection yielded 3 discordant results in endocervical specimens and 1 discordant result in male FVU by real-time PCR and ProbTec. Three of 4 reexamined using Aptime Combo 2 Assay (Fuji Rebio Inc.) were positive for C. trachomatis. Endocervical swab and FVU specimen results for C. trachomatis were discordant in 3 cases in real-time PCR and 4 in ProbeTec. Subjects with 2 or more positive endocervical awab results in female or male FVU specimens were assumed to be ""true positive"" for C. trachomatis. The sensitivities of real-time PCR for detecting C. trachomatis was 94.4% in endocervical swabs, 77.8% in female FVU and 97.4% in the male FVU. The sensitivities for real-time PCR for detectig N. gonorrhoeae was 100% in all 3 specimen types. Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay was useful for detecting C. trachomatis using endocervical swabs or male FVU specimens and for detecting N. gonorrhoeae using endocervical swabs and all FVU specimens."
0,Performance of the BD CTQx and GCQx Amplified Assays on the BD Viper LT Compared With the BD Viper XTR System,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000313,"We evaluated the BD Viper LT System for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using samples collected from symptomatic patients that included urine, vaginal swabs, and cervical samples in liquid-based cytology media. Results were compared with those obtained using the BD Viper XTR platform. The positive and negative percent agreements for all sample types were at least 95.8% and at least 96.4% for chlamydia and gonorrhea and at least 95.0% when both organisms were present, respectively. This medium throughput system performs well compared with a high-throughput platform and may offer smaller health care facilities the opportunity to test for these infections locally."
0,The performance and clinical utility of cervical microscopy for the diagnosis of gonorrhoea in women in the era of the NAAT,10.1177/0956462414551233,"We evaluated the performance and clinical utility of cervical microscopy for diagnosing genital gonorrhoea (GC) in women, using the APTIMA Combo 2 dual GC/Chlamydia trachomatis assay as the gold standard. Test performance was assessed overall and for patient subgroups (symptomatic, GC contacts, pelvic inflammatory disease [PID] diagnosis). It was found that 93 women had positive GC genital NAAT results; 15 had positive cervical microscopy (8 were GC contacts). In all subgroups except GC contacts, the PPV of cervical microscopy was below the nationally accepted target of 90%. Compared to APTIMA Combo 2, cervical microscopy has poor sensitivity for diagnosing GC in women (16.1% overall, 17.3% symptomatic, 25% GC contacts, 10.5% PID). GC contacts accounted for over 50% of the positive microscopy results and would have received epidemiological treatment for GC, regardless of the microscopy result. Discontinuing the routine use of cervical microscopy would improve patient flow through the sexual health clinic and resources could be utilised more effectively."
0,Safety of multiple administrations of spermicidal LL-37 antimicrobial peptide into the mouse female reproductive tract.,10.1093/molehr/gaad023,"We have previously demonstrated spermicidal activity of LL-37 antimicrobial peptide on mouse/human sperm and its contraceptive effects in female mice. With  its microbicidal action against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, LL-37 warrants development  into a multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) agent for administering into the  female reproductive tract (FRT). However, it is important to verify that multiple  administrations of LL-37 do not lead to damage of FRT tissues and/or irreversible  loss of fecundity. Herein, we transcervically injected LL-37 (36 µM-10×  spermicidal dose) into female mice in estrus in three consecutive estrous cycles.  A set of mice were sacrificed for histological assessment of the  vagina/cervix/uterus 24 h after the last injection, while the second set were  artificially inseminated with sperm from fertile males 1 week afterwards, and  then monitored for pregnancy. Mice injected with PBS in parallel were regarded as  negative controls, whereas those injected with vaginal contraceptive foam (VCF,  available over the counter), containing 12.5% nonoxynol-9, served as positive  controls for vaginal epithelium disruption. We demonstrated that the  vagina/cervix/uterus remained normal in both LL-37-injected and PBS-injected  mice, which also showed 100% resumption of fecundity. In contrast, VCF-injected  mice showed histological abnormalities in the vagina/cervix/uterus and only 50%  of them resumed fecundity. Similarly, LL-37 multiply administered intravaginally  caused no damage to FRT tissues. While our results indicate the safety of  multiple treatments of LL-37 in the mouse model, similar studies have to be  conducted in non-human primates and then humans. Regardless, our study provides  an experimental model for studying in vivo safety of other vaginal MPT/spermicide  candidates."
0,Genital tract microbiome dynamics are associated with time of Chlamydia infection in mice.,10.1038/s41598-023-36130-3,"We have previously shown that the time of Chlamydia infection was crucial in determining the chlamydial infectivity and pathogenesis. This study aims to  determine whether the time of Chlamydia infection affects the genital tract  microbiome. This study analyzed mice vaginal, uterine, and ovary/oviduct  microbiome with and without Chlamydia infection. The mice were infected with  Chlamydia at either 10:00 am (ZT3) or 10:00 pm (ZT15). The results showed that  mice infected at ZT3 had higher Chlamydia infectivity than those infected at  ZT15. There was more variation in the compositional complexity of the vaginal  microbiome (alpha diversity) of mice infected at ZT3 than those mice infected at  ZT15 throughout the infection within each treatment group, with both Shannon and  Simpson diversity index values decreased over time. The analysis of samples  collected four weeks post-infection showed that there were significant  taxonomical differences (beta diversity) between different parts of the genital  tract-vagina, uterus, and ovary/oviduct-and this difference was associated with  the time of infection. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla  within the microbiome in all three genital tract regions for all the samples  collected during this experiment. Additionally, Firmicutes was the dominant  phylum in the uterine microbiome of ZT3 Chlamydia infected mice. The results show  that the time of infection is associated with the microbial dynamics in the  genital tract. And this association is more robust in the upper genital tract  than in the vagina. This result implies that more emphasis should be placed on  understanding the changes in the microbial dynamics of the upper genital tract  over the course of infection."
0,Induction of protective immunity against Chlamydia muridarum intracervical infection in DBA/1j mice,10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.10.018,"We previously reported that intracervical inoculation with Chlamydia muridarum induced hydrosalpinx in DBA/1j mice, but intravaginal inoculation failed to do so. In the current study, we found unexpectedly that intrabursal inoculation of live chlamydial organisms via the oviduct failed to induce significant hydrosalpinx. We further tested whether primary infection via intravaginal or intrabursal inoculation could induce protective immunity against hydrosalpinx following intracervical challenge infection. Mice infected intravaginally with C. muridarum were fully protected from developing hydrosalpinx, while intrabursal inoculation offered partial protection. We then compared immune responses induced by the two genital tract inoculations. Both inoculations induced high IFNγ and IL-17 T cell responses although the ratio of IgG2a versus IgG1 in intravaginally infected mice was significantly higher than in mice infected intrabursally. When the antigen-specificities of antibody responses were compared, both groups of mice dominantly recognized 24 C. muridarum antigens, while each group preferentially recognized unique sets of antigens. Thus, we have demonstrated that intrabursal inoculation is neither effective for causing hydrosalpinx nor efficient in inducing protective immunity in DBA/1j mice. Intravaginal immunization, in combination with intracervical challenge infection in DBA/1j mice, can be a useful model for understanding mechanisms of chlamydial pathogenicity and protective immunity."
1,Gonococcal Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: Placing Mechanistic Insights Into the Context of Clinical and Epidemiological Observations,10.1093/infdis/jiab227,"While infection by Neisseria gonorrhoeae is often asymptomatic in women, undetected infections can ascend into the upper genital tract to elicit an inflammatory response that manifests as pelvic inflammatory disease, with the outcomes depending on the intensity and duration of inflammation and whether it is localized to the endometrial, fallopian tube, ovarian, and/or other tissues. This review examines the contribution of N. gonorrhoeae versus other potential causes of pelvic inflammatory disease by considering new insights gained through molecular, immunological, and microbiome-based analyses, and the current epidemiological burden of infection, with an aim to highlighting key areas for future study."
0,Sexually transmitted infections: challenges ahead,10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30310-9,"WHO estimated that nearly 1 million people become infected every day with any of four curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs): chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis. Despite their high global incidence, STIs remain a neglected area of research. In this Commission, we have prioritised five areas that represent particular challenges in STI treatment and control. Chlamydia remains the most commonly diagnosed bacterial STI in high-income countries despite widespread testing recommendations, sensitive and specific non-invasive testing techniques, and cheap effective therapy. We discuss the challenges for chlamydia control and evidence to support a shift from the current focus on infection-based screening to improved management of diagnosed cases and of chlamydial morbidity, such as pelvic inflammatory disease. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is globally recognised. We review current and potential future control and treatment strategies, with a focus on novel antimicrobials. Bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder in women, but current treatments are associated with frequent recurrence. Recurrence after treatment might relate to evidence that suggests sexual transmission is integral to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis, which has substantial implications for the development of effective management approaches. STIs disproportionately affect low-income and middle-income countries. We review strategies for case management, focusing on point-of-care tests that hold considerable potential for improving STI control. Lastly, STIs in men who have sex with men have increased since the late 1990s. We discuss the contribution of new biomedical HIV prevention strategies and risk compensation. Overall, this Commission aims to enhance the understanding of some of the key challenges facing the field of STIs, and outlines new approaches to improve the clinical management of STIs and public health."
0,Progress and Perspectives in Point of Care Testing for Urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis Infection: A Review,10.12659/MSM.920873,"Worldwide, genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. Most infections are asymptomatic. However, particularly in women, untreated infection with C. trachomatis can lead to complications that include pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and tubal ectopic pregnancy. Rapid methods for early and accurate diagnosis for infection with C. trachomatis that can be performed in the clinic would allow for earlier treatment to prevent complications. Traditional laboratory-based tests for C. trachomatis infection include culture, enzyme immunoassay, direct immunofluorescence, nucleic acid hybridization, and nucleic acid amplification tests, which take time but have high diagnostic sensitivity. Novel and rapid diagnostic tests include extraordinary optical transmission (EOT), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (MAMEF). Although these new tests offer the promise of rapid screening and diagnosis, they may have lower diagnostic sensitivity. This review aims to provide an overview of traditional methods for the diagnosis of urogenital infection with C. trachomatis, the current status of POC testing for urogenital C. trachomatis infection and discusses recent progress and perspectives."
